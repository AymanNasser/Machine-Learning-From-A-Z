# AI for Everyone

## Key Steps of A Machine Learning Project

> 1. Collect data 
> 2. Train model. ***iterate many times until good enough***
> 3. Deploy model. ***maintain & update model***

## Key Steps of a Data Science Project

> 1. Collect data
> 2. Analyze data. 
>   1. __iterate many times to get good insights & ideas__

## General Tips
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) is the type of AI used in todayâ€™s email spam filters, speech recognition, 
 and other specific applications

- Regarding data acquisition: 
  - Some types of data are more valuable than others; working with an AI team can help us figure 
 out what data to acquire
 
- Deep learning:
> - [x] Is a type of machine learning (i.e., all deep learning algorithms are machine learning 
 algorithms)
> - [x] The terms __deep learning__ & __neural network__ are used almost *_interchangeably_*
___  
 - AI companies do well:
 > - [x] Strategic data acquisition
 > - [x] Investments in unified data warehouses
 > - [x] Spot automation opportunities
___
- Pitfall: __Expecting 100% accuracy__ due to:
> - [x] Limitations of ML
> - [x] Insufficient data
> - [x] Mislabeled data
> - [x] Ambiguous labels
___
