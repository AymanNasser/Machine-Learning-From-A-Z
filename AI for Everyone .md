# AI for Everyone

## Key Steps of A Machine Learning Project

1. Collect data 
2. Train model. __iterate many times until good enough__
3. Deploy model. __maintain & update model__

## Key Steps of a Data Science Project

1. Collect data
2. Analyze data. __iterate many times to get good insights & ideas__
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions. __deploy changes & re-analyze new data periodically__

 
 
 
 ## General Tips
 - Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) is the type of AI used in todayâ€™s email spam filters, speech recognition, 
 and other specific applications
 
 - Regarding data acquisition: 
 - [x] Some types of data are more valuable than others; working with an AI team can help us figure 
 out what data to acquire
 
 - Deep learning:
 - [x] Is a type of machine learning (i.e., all deep learning algorithms are machine learning 
 algorithms)
 - [x] The terms __deep learning__ & __neural network__ are used almost *_interchangeably_*
  
 - AI companies do well:
 - [x] Strategic data acquisition
 - [x] Investments in unified data warehouses
 - [x] Spot automation opportunities
 
- Pitfall: __Expecting 100% accuracy__ due to:
- [x] Limitations of ML
- [x] Insufficient data
- [x] Mislabeled data
- [x] Ambiguous labels
