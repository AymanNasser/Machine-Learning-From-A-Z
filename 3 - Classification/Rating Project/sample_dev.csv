0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,After a long and arduous ten hour flight  followed by a crazy and dangerous shuttle drive ride down the San Francisco streets  we were met with a cordial  welcome from the young concierge at Hotel Diva who effortlessly sorted out the dispute with the aggressive driver. This was mirrored by the Receptionist who was charming and efficient. Our room was fairly small but well proportioned with all the required amenities. The hotel was in an excellent location in the centre of Union Square. There are many restaurants within walking distance  but I would recommend you book beforehand to avoid disappointment. There is a diner across the street which serves an excellent breakfast at a reasonable price! I would definately stay here again and will be recommending it to my British travel company  Hayes and Jarvis.,Positive

The room  we had a suite  was spacious and comfortable. Only drawback was lack of a view (we looked into another building... creepy) We felt like we were in a hole with no windows because we couldn't open our curtains due to feeling like we were constantly being watched.The service was top notch... Oliver felt like a personal friend. He was genuinely helpful and anticipated our needs before we knew we needed him. He suggested wonderful restaurants  parking tips  sightseeing info... the list goes on and on. The front desk was pleasant and the bartender made wonderful drinks.Loved the roof top patio... a little difficult to find but worth the walk up the stairs from the 10th fl.We will definitely stay at the Orchard Garden the next time we visit SF!Thank you so much for the stellar review. Although I am very pleased to read you enjoyed your stay  I apologize the view was less than desirable. Our property was built in 2006 on a vacant lot next to some tall neighboring buildings. I am thrilled Oliver and the front desk team we were able to make your stay more pleasurable. I am extremely fortunate to work with such an enthusiastic team.All of us here look forward to your next San Francisco visit.All the best Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager,Positive

There is also many areas to visit including a walk to the Shelter Island for a romantic walk. The hotel staff and service is immaculate and the rooms are really nice with a elegant touch and clean. Cant get better for the price I paid. Spend a little more and get room 9  it will not disappoint.Thank you kindly for your review. Stoked to hear you enjoyed your stay and our hood!

I've stayed here over 15 times over the past decade but never wrote a review. But it's time to give praise where it's due.First  the location -- on an island across a short causeway from the heart of the Brickell business district  the hotel has beautiful views in all directions. The rooms are spacious  beautifully furnished  extremely comfortable  and with true state-of-the-art support for all of your electronics -- there's a well placed single large panel in the desk area with plugs for chargers  ethernet cables  3 prong plugs -- everything you can imagine.All the rooms have floor-to-ceiling glass facing the water and city views  balconies  large bathrooms and abundant closet space. I've been in everything from their basic rooms to suites -- all were gracious and comfortable.The two restaurants are excellent  and the buffet breakfast in the Cafe Simbal is exceptionally abundant  everything of highest quality  and with exceptionally broad choices. The pool is a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the bay with outdoor shower and jacuzzi facilities  and the large nearby beach area is quiet  calm and well serviced by staff who are gracious  helpful and unintrusive. The spa is elegant and the exercise room is very large and as good as the most extravagant private facility.All of these types of choices and preferences are matters of personal choice  but I've tried more than my share of South Beach hip places and they were uniformly bad compared to the Mandarin. And because Miami is so spread out  you'll need a car or taxi (as you need no matter where you stay)  but the Mandarin is actually very central and equidistant by car to Coconut Grove  Coral Gables  South Beach and Key Biscayne.As chain hotels go  this is as good as any in the US. As a very discerning and experienced traveler with opinions (see my other reviews!)  this one deserves its reputation and for the quality of rooms  location  food and service  is fairly priced.,Positive

The included morning breakfast was more than adequate and although we did not partake in the evening weekday meals  they too looked good. For a traveling family  this is a real bargain. The staff was extremely courteous. Will definitely stay here again  when we are in the Orlando area,Positive
0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend. We loved San Diego and this hotel was in a great location. Walking distance (and safe walking day or night) to the Gaslamp Quarter and to the Harbour. And the street does not get too much traffic so uber/taxi/shuttle pick up and drop off is easy (10 minute drive to the zoo and SeaWorld and Petco Park). The room itself was fantastic. We got a room with a great view of the city and bay. The room was very clean with great air con  comfy bed  and hot shower. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the wifi. It's free  but it was useless. Could not stay connected and when I could it was awfully slow. But we still had a good time and this hotel overall  only enhanced our stay in San Diego. We will be back! (hopefully the wifi will be improved by the time we do ) )EN4C3R- Thank you for your loyalty to the Westin San Diego. We are so thrilled you enjoy our location  breakfast and the Westin Heavenly brand products. We are also currently planning our CAT6 wifi upgrade throughout the entire hotel and will be very excited when this is completed. We look forward to your return to sunny San Diego and getting that 5 star review from you next time!Be Well  Alyssa Turowski  General Manager,Positive

We had a room that was designed for disabled person and this gave us the extra room in bathroom which was a bonus  after most of the tiny bathrooms we have had during our trip. Our key kept becoming unusable and needed us to go back down to reception to have it re-programmed which was a pain. Breakfast was very ordinary. The downside of the sleeping was that it is very noisy  lots of street noise on 2nd floor  and an air-conditioner that kept cutting in and out all night. Very low signal for wi-fi although it did work.,Positive

Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about  but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad   and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.,Negative

We have Executive club access so that always makes a stay very enjoyable and the staff in the lounge were particularly helpful. The hotel has recently been refurbished and while still very Marriott in style is has more personal touchs that I have seen in other properties. Big plus points are the location  loads of great restaurants in easy walking distance  wonderful friendly helpful staff at all levels and a new thing was the little market shop by reception which was fantastic  not only the sweets etc that you would expect but drawers of everything from new shirts and ties to aspirin etc plus although pricey not unreasonable - my 4 headache pills were 3 but a necessity at the time. The only reason I am not giving the hotel and excellent is the very long wait for room service on Sunday night  Our pizza took forever to arrive and we had 2 or 3 phone calls to see if it was there or not which didn't inspire confidence that it was ever coming!,Positive

The rooms remain comfortable  however my only hang up is what I would call a design flaw rather than a hotel comfort/staffing issue. The shower heads are not very good  and also the shower door opens into the shower  getting water on the outside of the shower and on the floor just outside the shower.

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,Here's the short version of my 5 nights at this hotel. King bed was bottomed out on one side..the other side was fine so I just slept on the one good side. No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss...no problem boss you got it boss  etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew  but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was..or wish me a good trip as I left..I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport. This whole area is heavily impacted by traffic.,Negative

Rooms will be good for another few years before they need a refurbish. I would only suggest that they take a look at some of the electrical sockets as they made static noise when being used. Also another concern was windows open so if you have children I see a real hazard!!! Everything was clean and as promised on the web site.

After calling  they credited the brunch  but would not take off the 3 for a water in the room (not included as a drink). Amazing that after all the hassle  the 3 charge was not credited.Nice atmosphere  but with this type of customer service I will stay elsewhere going forward.Hello dwyejj  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Found:re Phx.

I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax  total 186 USD incl. tax)  but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax  that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.,Negative

The rooms are spacious  and some rooms come with a murphy bed. The dcor is clean and metropolitan  but the window shades have silhouettes of scantily-clad women which some might find unnecessary. The bathrooms  or shall I say toilet rooms have a shower/tub and toilet  while the actual sink is in the room itself. It's difficult not to wake your partner if you get up at night for water or brush your teeth. The staff was uber-friendly!

After going into our smelly rooms I literally walked back out  cancelled our booking via a website booking dot com (burning 400 for that nights accommodation)  loaded up the car and drove around at 6-7pm at night on a Friday - till I found another place for our 3 night visit  which was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. The other place was actually pretty average but got a great deal and recouped the 400 on room rates  way closer to the Wharf/Lombard/Girardelli's area.

You'd swear you're just steps from a beach but you're in the middle of the mountains.Props to the staff! Carla Bhumi. Once you check in you are in good hands and on a very quality property. However  don't expect to check in before check in time. So  if you arrive early  expect to be told not yet. Parking right next to the hotel is limited. But there is a satellite lot just a few more steps away. Not a problem  unless it's raining. Speaking of which  it did on our trip  just enough to not be able to enjoy the outdoor pool which looked very inviting!The indoor pool does not allow any eating or drinking...eh not a fan of that policy. There is no smoking on the property  not even on your own balcony. Understandable because you're pretty close to your neighbors  but still would have liked to enjoy a cigar and beer in the evenings. Instead there's a rickety table and chair in the corner of the parking lot you can traipse to if you have to smoke. OK  unless it's raining.The rooms are exquisite - for budget style hotels. And you can't beat the location  right next to the Island at Pigeon Forge. Several attractions are within walking distance but drivers in Pigeon Forge are horrible. Some don't even look before they turn and run red lights. If you're with kids  be on the lookout.If you can't get enough Jimmy Buffet lifestyle  there's a Margaritaville restaurant and Margaritaville coffee shop less than a 5 minute walk away.Also  need to mention  the breakfast they serve is a cut above those you would find at other breakfast included budget hotels.This place is really done right. Would love to stay here again on my next visit to Pigeon Forge.Thank you for staying at our hotel and for sharing your great feedback. We are so happy your enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you during your next visit to Pigeon Forge.,Positive

I used HotelTonight to reserve this and paid 480/ night as that was actually decent during this peak week and lack of notice. Some of the reviews on here made me concerned  and after my stay prompted me to make an account so I could leave a review. Overall  a very decent place. Room was clean  bed was comfortable  and bathroom very nice. The toilet and shower are in the bathroom  the sink was outside in the room. I saw some reviews complaining about this  however was no big deal at all to me. Shower seemed newer than the rest of the room. There's a Starbucks connected to the hotel which is very convenient for picking up a team coffee order before heading to Moscone. I also dropped off my laundry in the morning my first full day and received it back in my room that evening after returning from a busy day. They also have a 24 hour gym which has an elliptical  free weights and some equipment. Gym was clean and overall equipment new. Would stay here again!

A great rate  a great location  staff was very helpful and accommodating. Joel (front manager) checked me in and his level of helpfulness and enthusiasm was impressive for a jaded traveler like me. The property is dated but charming  bed was one of the best I've had in a hotel in a while. Bath situation is a little cramped  street noise can be pretty significant  and food options are pretty limited (sushi only  best as I could tell  though I'm not a big user of room service). But the whole experience was very good and I intend to be go back. One petty note...the staff gave a good push for their Joy of Life Club and since I have stayed at a number of Joie de Vivre properties and liked them all  I decided to sign up. Enrollment was not particularly convenient  and it turns out they will only credit stays booked directly through their web site  yet my employer requires me to book through our corporate travel site...so all that trouble to enroll and I will probably never get any points. If you're going to use a club to encourage repeat visits  it ought to be easy and encouraging  not difficult and overly restrictive.Hello We truly appreciate your feedback and I am glad that you enjoyed the hotel. We have forwarded your review to Joel as well. By your comments  it seems that our staff may have misinformed you on the types of bookings that can receive points. Any reservation booked directly through the hotel will recieve points. These eligible bookings also include some corporate travel sites that do not utilize a 3rd party prepayment method. We do not award points for 3rd party prepaid reservations such as Expedia  Hotwire  Hotels.com  etc. I am sorry for any confusion this caused. You have received your points for this stay already. If you have stayed at any other JDV properties in the last 30 days or so  I can also award points for those stays. Again  thank you for your positive review on TripAdvisor and your time.

After checking in and taking out luggage to the room we discovered that the couch pull out bed was completely broken. We had only been in the room about 5 minutes. I went to the desk to ask about changing rooms or having the bed fixed. They would not move us and the bed was ...not repairable. SO  we literally had to remove the mattress from the couch and place it on the floor to sleep. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a Marriott Brand Hotel. The room price was not reduced or any concessions made for our horrible night. I am a Marriott lover  but I may have to consider changing my hotel brand.,Negative

Overall the staff were friendly except for when we checked in. We went to the lounge after check in and waited over 15 minutes before being acknowledged (while sitting at the bar)  and then another 10 minutes before we received a drink. I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year  but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun. The rooms are a bit difficult to locate as there are multiple buildings and levels.,Positive

Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small  but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable  but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills  elipticals  and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout  ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall  Old Town  and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times  particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby  but there are also cheaper fast food places.,Positive

Napa is one of those places where 300+ a night rooms are common. My room was about 100 (Motel 6  next door  was about 20 less). The room was small  clean  with a mini fridge and microwave. Everything worked. Beds average for comfort. Dog friendly at 25 per dog per night empty lot on side of hotel to walk them. One of the best dog parks in California  Alston Park  is a 5 minute car ride away. Starbucks just across the street. Hot tub not used but looked very clean. On the downside  you could hear creaking with every step of the person in the room above. Old non-flat panel tv with limited channels. Room heater a bit noisy. Convenient but busy location. Would stay here again.Booking note: While waiting to check in I overheard part of a conversation regarding some kind of problem with the room/reservation with another guest. The management was responding by telling the guest they couldn't do anything about the issue since they had booked thru a third party. The you didn't pay us  you paid them line. I see this more and more these days with hotels  airlines  etc. It seems to be a technique to encourage people to book directly with the business. I am not saying the Chablis Inn is a bad guy here I don't know the specifcs. I am just pointing out the general issue of how one books travel and how it affects you if there is a problem.I appreciate all of the positive information that you shared. We continue to upgrade our property and addressing the T.V's and programming offered is currently being reviewed.The guest issue was unfortunate. The guest had purchased a voucher as part of a promotion that was non-refundable. The guest did stay for the duration of the promotion and enjoyed the stay and all of her promotional package.

The previous two years were enjoyable stays. This year was terrible. The television and internet did not work most of the weekend. Went down to breakfast and was told there was no juice because they were not prepared for the number of guests. The lobby  walkway in front of the elevators  and dining area were torn up the entire weekend. I am shocked that renovations would be planned during a busy weekend. So very disappointed!

We were a little nervous about the location (don't be). It is in the perfect location  and fit our needs. We stayed on the second floor facing Fell Street. Yes  it is noisy with the cars - but we fell asleep from all our activities. The shower/toilet situation was perfect. We were busy during the day  and it was a great place to come rest and take a shower. If you are on a budget - this place is for you. The front desk were helpful  and were always willing to help with stamps  maps  change  directions  etc. Continental breakfast in the morning  and the best beverage machine. I would not recommend this place for kids  or the rooms in the center with the courtyard not facing the street. We had to move the last night  the room was smaller and it was hot and more noise came from other rooms rather than outside. Good thing was our last night we were there for a couple of hours to sleep. We will stay here again you can not beat the price - especially in San Francisco!,Positive

Room had separate living and bedroom areas  a wet bar in the living room  and two bathrooms. The condition of the room was great  with everything very clean and well maintained. The hotel also has underground parking with elevator access to each floor  a really nice convenience. The complimentary breakfast was very good both days and was well stocked despite being quite busy. We were somewhat concerned about being 15 miles from downtown as we were in San Diego for a concert  but were pleased that the location is actually very accessible and is only 20 minutes from Petco Park and the harbour area.

I'm glad that for the most part  you enjoyed your stay. Although our front desk computers are due for a hardware upgrade  I find it hard to believe that the computers were the cause for it taking 20 minutes to check out. Perhaps it was operator error The staff at the desk is fairly new  but they shouldn't really have many problems checking somebody out. I will get with the staff to see if they remember any specific issues with guests checking out over the past few days. Thanks for your feedback  and we hope to see you again real soon.,Positive

Upon arrival was very suprised by cute street apeal and friendly reception area  after receiving our room key we ventured around the lobby area and found the pool. The pool is in the courtyard area in the middle of the building. It is very grotto like and almost had a european feel with its rustic charm yet small and charming feel. Unfortunatelly  we did not use the pool but did take advantage of the small breakfast bar the next morning in the lobby area that was just enough to get you up and going to take on the town. The room was on the top level which is actually an outdoor hallway terrace that winds around different corners offering a few views of the city. Luckily it was a warm day and we were able sit out on our own patio terrace directly outside our room. Inside the room- very clean and suprisingly large  we shared with another couple and had more than enough room for the 4 of us. The bathroom was a little outdated but it was still functional and clean (most important). Upon checkout we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who knew the city well and helped with out bags by a team of skilled bell staff. Overall- great place to stay  walking distance to anything in the bourbon street area  safe  clean  and offered a comfortable NOLA experience.,Positive

The hotel and room were clean and up-to-date. The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens. The location was decent  located along the boardwalk with a number of restaurants  shops  and other hotels. Once we were there  we didn't have to drive anywhere since there was enough to keep us entertained close by.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy at night. There were a few people from the nearby bars yelling on the sidewalk  but fortunately it was brief and not late enough to wake us up. Also  the waves were much louder than we'd expected while trying to sleep  but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. Might be something to keep in mind if you are looking for a beach-front hotel. However  overall it was a fabulous experience!Thank you so much for the great TA review!

From the bellhop/valet to the front desk staff to everyone we met at the hotel  one could not find friendlier or more helpful people. This is a boutique hotel  and the location is perfect. The rooms are comfortable  and they have free wifi. There is a coffee setup on the mezzanine level in the mornings  and complimentary wine served in the lobby in the evening. There is valet parking  but like most places in San Francisco  it is expensive (38 plus taxes). We had a problem with our in room safe (we overstuffed it and jammed it so that it would not open). It was resolved almost immediately. About the only negative is that the restaurant is undergoing ownership changes/renovation  and is closed. We were hoping to have breakfast with our family and this change caught us by surprise (we had booked the rooms a year ago). Matt and Michelle (sales managers) could not have been more accommodating. They arranged for us to be able to have breakfast at the Bread Cocoa (just outside)  and to have them run a tab for our guests. They were also nice enough to upgrade the bride (our daughter) to the nicest suite in the hotel  and to have a bottle of champagne for the couple to make it up to us. We loved our stay  as did our family and friends. We know where we will be staying when we next visit San Francisco.,Positive

I needed to switch mine out twice and from the people struggling to use them in the elevators  I know I wasn't the only one. We were told this is a new system so hopefully they can work out the bugs. It was very frustrating. 2) elevators. Woof. During the busy morning times  it took forever! And it would have been easy to take the stairs but there is NO access from the stairs to the ground floor without setting off a fire alarm. This seems like it would be any easy fix so hopefully they can do it soon because it was bad!Jared80525 Thank you for staying with us next to the Seattle Center! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family  we are more than appreciative of your feedback. I sincerely apologize about the inconveniences of the elevators and the door locks during your stay. Please know we are diligently working on correcting these areas to improve our guest experience. Your feedback is essential to us and we hope to have the opportunity as our guest once again. Sarah Junge,Positive

0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Stayed 2 nights in April 2013. Well maintained and nicely landscaped property. The property is on a hill overlooking the Main Street of old Town San Diego with more Mexican restaurants than you ever thought possible. Getting back to your room on the hill may be a workout since you are going uphill. Bed was very comfortable and firm as that is my personal preference. The property covers 5+ acres so navigating the several different buildings can be a little tricky although they provide a colorful property map. The property is definitely older but it is clean and I did feel safe there at night although it is not the best lit property at night. Rooms are a little dark  however  and my room did not have a balcony and am not sure any did. They have two parking garages but small. They do charge 14/night extra for self parking. Overall  a good stay if you are looking for a sale  clean comfortable place to use as a base to do the tourist thing.Thank you for making the Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town your base for San Diego adventures! We appreciate the thoughtfulness you put into your review. It will be helpful for guests planning travel. If you have a specific preference of room location  please dont hesitate to ask before your next stay.

I stayed here for a conference and the meeting facilities were also great. The food was to die for and it seemed like it was never ending! My room was on the 15th floor and was very comfortable. The king size bed was cozy and I enjoyed having the option of separate bath or shower. The only two things I wasn't that jazzed about was the room rate (400ish per night -- and that was discounted) and the decor seemed a bit dated. All in all it was a good experience and I would stay again!Dear KikiB228 I'm so glad to hear our staff took great care of you during your stay and that you enjoyed our hotel. :) Yes  San Francisco is expensive and I know the rates can sting a bit sometimes.

Easy walking distance to riverfront  a little farther to Bourbon St. We were pretty low when we stayed and one night was VERY noisy outside. Ask for a higher room. The staff was very pleasant and competent and the facility was very clean. The breakfast buffet was pretty good (considering the price) and the dining room was 4x bigger than you would typically see in a free breakfast area. The afternoon Happy Hour was always fun. We saw a lot of New Orleans from there  with the exception of the Garden District. Very good stay and I would go back there on my next visit to NOLA.

The bedroom area contained a lovely Marriott bed and the large main bathroom had a powerful shower with plenty of space for products and two sinks. There was also a bathroom adjacent to the main living room area. Both of the flat-screen TVs had loads of channels (Direct TV)  which was a big bonus.On the first night  the Exec lounge was closed due to some maintenance issues  but I was given a voucher for a free appetizer in the bar  complimentary soft drinks and free buffet breakfast in the restaurant the next morning (which was excellent and of a very high-quality).As promised  the next day the Exec lounge was open again in the evening. It had a good selection in the morning including a couple of hot items and several different types of bagels. It was busy though  due to a Pepsi conference being held in the hotel.I loved the outdoor pool and patio area  although it closed after Labor Day  which I thought was a pity during a Chicago heat wave. The indoor pool remained open during my stay.Strangely  on day 2 of my booking  my room was never made up. When I informed the staff  they nearly burst out crying and quickly sent up extra amenities and cleared away my overflowing rubbish bins.There is a large grocery store across the street (Dominick's) and several restaurants within easy walking distance.The free shuttle service took about 15 minutes to get to the airport.I look forward to staying at this property again the next time I'm in the Chicago area.4 out of 5 stars,Positive

When they found out we were there to celebrate a special occasion my 50 Birthday they went out of there way to make me feel special. The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful  well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs  and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool. Before you leave you must stop by Clover Grill on 900 Bourbon Street for the worlds best breakfast you will ever eat. If you are going to New Orleans and need a place to stay don't hesitate choose this hotel you won't regret it.,Positive

We didn't know we were staying in the Annex until we checked in. It was disgusting  loud  and felt unsafe. The hotel room doors slammed shut all night long and it was loud until 3:30 am. For 350/night you expect a much cleaner  well-maintained and professional environment. Management did not even contact us about our experience after leaving a comment card about the condition of the room  which leads you to believe they either don't care or have heard it all before. Also  you can forget about using the roof top deck that they pump up so much on their website. They try and charge you 30/person to get in  up sell you with bottle service when the environment is so scummy and gross. For every Jersey Shore Meathead present  there is a security guard covered in tattoos. It's just a weird  unsafe and uneventful scene.,Negative

It got pretty loud with laughing and joking in the morning  plus 2 rude German women having a conversation and cigarette right outside the door which woke us up. Even after I went out this didn't bother them until I made my feelings known. The room was very clean  however a bit dated in terms of decor. Late afternoon/early evening we couldn't get a signal for the TV or WiFi but the weather was quite poor.There is a lack of plug sockets which was a bug bear for us  although as we were only staying for the night we got by.All in all its a good and clean place to rest your head if you aren't expecting the Hilton.,Positive

We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers  movie theater  and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions  walking distance shopping mall and restaurants.

We had seven nights here in May 2014 and really enjoyed staying there. It is a cute little hotel  modernized and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were great and I am very fussy! We had a view of the disgusting building next door  and a tiny peep of the sea! Honestly  given the quality of the hotel  the cost  and the little time we spent in our room  it was not a big deal. Why would you pay for a resort hotel and view when it appears you can use the facilities of the pools on the beach anyway during the day. If we ever return to Waikiki  we will be staying at the Shoreline again.Aloha Megan FThank you for your 4 star review. We are thrilled knowing we exceeded your expectations and were able to provide a memorable stay. While it is true we are not a bigger resort our hotel more than makes up for it with our centralized location  complimentary amenities  and competitive room rates. Not to mention our hotel does not charge any resort fees that bigger hotels charge. While it is unfortunate that the view from your room was not to your liking our city view accommodations face the surrounding areas of where this building is placed.

Ok people  the whole concept about boutique hotels are that they are small  unique with their usage of limited space and fairly reasonable because of it. If your principle concerns to have a large spacious luxury suite  than the Hilton millennium is down Michigan ave and will cost you at least 4 times the price. Then you can complain about the high cost of staying in Chicago. The Felix is located just 4 short blocks west of the Magnificent Mile and about a 15 minute stroll to the Navy Pier. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We arrived at just about noon and our room was ready. It was clean and fresh and the bed was very comfortable. There are numerous restaurants all around the facility and the area feels very safe. There is complimentary coffee and tea every morning and their is a small bar with limited times and services available.Overall we found our stay very comfortable and made our weekend in the Windy City a very enjoyable one.Hi Bolte59 - Thank you very much for posting your review.

The room was very clean  and furnished nicely (just not as nicely as the room featured on the website). There were a few issues with my room  some which can be easily remedied  some that can not. First  the shower was poorly designed so whenever it is on water will splash on the floor. The guest across the hall from me requested a shower curtain. There are no built-in shower caddies for soap and shampoo but I found plastic ones with suction cups on the floor of the shower. I thought they had been left there  perhaps to dry after being sanitized. Several times I attempted to stick them on the wall of the shower  but every time they would fall  startling me. The deadbolt on my room door did not lock properly. Every evening the noise from the Mexican restaurant downstairs was very disruptive. It sounded almost like my bed was in the middle of the dining room. I can tune-out almost any noise  but my wife  who is a light sleeper  would've had a hard time getting to sleep. Bottom line  not worth the price.Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate experience with us. We are very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I am not sure if you already reported these issues in regards to your deadbolt and shower caddie but if you have not  do you mind emailing me directly so I can retain your room number and get these items fixed We greatly appreciate you sharing this feedback with us as it allows us the opportunity to improve in the future.

Centrally located in the loop close to restaurants  theaters and shopping. The hotel is exquisite in its decor. The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you. Every evening between 5-6pm with your room key there is free Proseco or Sangria in the lobby bar area. And believe me all the guests take advantage of it. Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints. Rooms decent size for downtown. Love their amenities. Bonus there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor. I usually am not disappointed by a Kimpton property and I can add this one to the list. Great customer service and a charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!,Positive

Booked it because ratings show 3.5 stars. Well  this is false. This hotel does not deserve more than 1 star. It has roaches  and I killed two or three of them. The carpet was extremely dirty with burnt mark and foul smell. The bed was not comfortable. It is definitely not a deluxe hotel. This is not a home away from home.,Negative

We travel often to Europe and felt the European character. My wife and I do not need a lot of amenities-but their exercise room and bar were enough. Since the 'Big Easy' has plenty of excellent restaurants and this hotel was within a very few blocks of the heart of the French Quarter  we did not expect a full restaurant. I would mention that next time I would want to be told that my room did not have windows!!Simple  comfortable and all you need. We do have some great views for your next visit  be sure to book the Aloft rooms so we are able to find the best one for you.Dixie Krauss  Director of Operations,Positive

I don't like to have staff in my room during my stay so I can not comment on housekeeping other than to say the housekeeper was very friendly and took care of our towel and trash needs with a smile everyday. The elevators can be a drag since there are only two small ones but we just avoided the rush periods and were fine. I agree with other reviews in that we felt safe at all hours walking in the area. We would stay again!Dear Valued Guest Thank you so much for sharing your review with us! We really appreciate you choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs and hope you had a great time during your visit.

0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,So i had no idea what to expect with the Moxy going into it  but after one minute of being there  I knew that the place was amazing. First off  I have never been so entertained at a hotel. The music was fun to dance to  the drinks were phenominal  just ask Kathleen to make you one  and the games were so fun! (They had a two player pacman machine!!) The room itself was pretty sweet  and we had a wonderful view of the skyscrapers around the city. The front desk was amazing giving us restaurant recommendations  i forgot his name  but was either like David or Matt... point is the guy working at the Front Desk was awesome. They are like your best friends and treat you like a guest  not a peasant. Zombie Taco had wonderful food  and the lady behind the counter was wonderful. The single complaint  which isn't even that big of a deal for me  was that the bed was slightly firmer for my friend  but that wasn't even that bad for him. The housekeeping was great  front desk was great  Moxy Chicago was great. I will always keep them in mind when coming to stay in Chicago again  because they made my trip absolutely amazing.Hey Daniel P!YOUR GREAT! Thanks for hanging out with our crew at the Moxy Chicago! We love to hear that enjoyed our unique amenities and delicious tacos. We can't wait to have you back already! Peace. Love. Moxy.,Positive

1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Our family of five (myself  my wife  and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday  onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival  which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon  an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room  took down my cell phone number  and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm  stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK  we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away  and away  and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic  they tried to offer a handicap accessible room  which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart  tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding  now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room  but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job  when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice  or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us  they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case  I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review  because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may further discuss the details of your stay  and how we may improve this unfortunate experience.

I'm not an expert on new Orleans but it seemed a little safer/ quieter than bourbon street.Thank you for the wonderful comments and for taking the time to let everyone know about your visit.

0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,We chose to stay at the French Market Inn largely based on reviews we read here on Trip Advisor. All reviews we read here are accurate  so we knew in advance what to expect. The location is superb for leisure travelers. Close to the French Market  Jax Brewery  Jackson Square and the Cathedral. The Natchez steamboat is just across the street. Easy walking distance to shopping  good restaurants and the activities of the French Quarter. Valet parking was a breeze. Check-in was smooth. The lobby is beautiful. Every single member of staff we encountered provided great customer service. Lonnie is great - he is everywhere all at once. We loved Patrick the cat  but only had the chance to meet him at night. When you read other reviews that the rooms are small  they are not kidding. It is what it is  just be forewarned - this we expected based on reading the reviews here. On the plus side  our shower was fantastic and probably the best water pressure I've ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world - that was a pleasant surprise. Beds were very comfortable. There is no bar or restaurant on the premises  but there is a lovely courtyard where people gather to relax and bring their own beverage. Nice little pool - it is on the small side. Vending machines and ice maker are in a room facing the courtyard.The French Market Inn is definitely good value for money  and we plan on staying here again on our next visit to NOLA.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback - we're happy to hear that your stay met your expectations. We appreciate your kind words about our location  accommodations  and service. Our staff works hard to make sure great guest experiences happen every day.

A two burner electric cooktop  pans and plates and flatware provided. We had a corner room by the monorail but didnt hear anything. Had a little living area with a couch. More than enough room for two people. The breakfast was included and was great! Made to order omelettes  yogurt  French toast  etc  etc. It was great to be able to cook for when you didnt feel like going out- though there is plenty right nearby! Super comfy beds and nice blackout curtains. Highly recommend!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I am very glad that you chose to make us your home base for your Seattle adventure.

I booked one of the slightly larger rooms  which made my stay more enjoyable. It had a couch and table to accompany the more standard hotel furniture and king-size bed. Someone referred to the furniture as office  but it would more properly just be called urban contemporary. I rather liked it. The bathroom was a bit small and not the greatest  but it sufficed. Not too many TV channels  but a nice large TV and free internet. The location is very convenient to BART  Union Square shopping  theaters  artsy places  restaurants  and larger conference hotels (such as the Hilton). The area is active  bustling  and a little gritty  but nothing to be too worried about as a guest. Overall  I would recommend it  and I definitely plan to stay there again when I need a room in downtown San Francisco.,Positive

No elevators despite 5 floors  no handicapped access  despite ADA laws. A non-responsive corporate office for this multi state  chain of single rooms rented by the week is less than 5 miles away  at Paces Ferry Rd.  so there's no excuse. They don't return calls or emails.Most employees here are pleasant  but as we all know  one incompetent individual can bring down a hard earned reputation. Reservations were not recorded by the woman  and repair orders went weeks unacknowledged  including toilet overflowing issues  electrical hazards of broken sockets and short circuiting of outlets and kitchen burners. Thankfully  we rarely cooked. Good restaurants chains in the area are a plus. No air conditioning in the room or repair effort in six months. Must be owned by a billionaire I'd suppose  since rooms lay vacant and Ms. Murphy has no problem sassing the guests or playing the slumlord.Holes in the walls  the room was infested with bed and other bugs  mice. A dirtier room I had never seen before. A few hired hands  paint  steamer  laundry bug spray clean up a place well  if you need a good location  at a cheap price  which is what we did. Your own stuff  can make it comfortable for an extended stay. Security personnel  Miss Melanie and manager are excellent  polite  reputable and we never had any valuables go missing during a year using this Piedmont Circle facility.,Negative

The bathroom was nice with granite/marble (who can tell the difference anymore). Bed was great. Nice size room. Really nothing negative to say. I am typically a boutique hotel kind of guy for vacation  but if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Seattle  this is not a bad option. I stayed at the W before I moved to this hotel. I liked this hotel better than the W. Quite a statement coming from someone who has stayed at several W hotels around the world and recommend them. If the rate is decent  consider this option. It is typically that big hotel feel  but worth the stay.,Positive

The Executive King rooms are large  especially for San Francisco hotels  and comfortable. The disadvantage is that they face Kearny Street  and there is traffic noise all day and night (the hotel staff will give you earplugs!). The front desk staff and the valets/bell men are helpful and friendly. The wine hour is a wonderful late afternoon offering. There are many good restaurants and tourist sites within walking distance. There are two negatives: the housekeeping is inconsistent  some days much more thorough than others  and the parking is very expensive (not unexpected in San Francisco).Nevertheless  we will certainly return a third time!,Positive

Whilst the hotel is comfortable  and the rooms are showing their age  it's still number one for its location to Disneyland. If you choose to drive  there is limited parking at the hotel. They offer a free breakfast (donuts  fruit  porridge and cereals  tea/coffee  waffles) While not the best  you can't beat the price. If you wish to eat out  there is a Denny's in front of the Del Sol bit we would recommend the IHOP  just down the road at the lights on Harbor Blvd. The hotel also had an excellent free wifi service as well.About 500ms East down Harbor Blvd you will find CVS pharmacy  which carries all the essential items including milk  cereals etc  including alcohol - a bigger selection and much cheaper to those couple of stores near Del Sol.If your visiting Disneyland  this is a excellent choice for both comfort and convenience. A note to remember - we stayed in room 111 and the fridge couldn't be turned down  hence everything  including our milk was frozen.,Positive

We repeatedly asked for suggestions and got great places as well as directions. The hotel was clean. The pool wasn't large but it was nice  equal parts of shade and sun available. Try using the concierge to book your tours  you could get money off. I wish the shampoo  conditioner and body gel didn't smell so masculine but I did appreciate the eco friendly refillable bottles in the shower instead of the travel bottles.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,While booking this trip  I was looking for an affordable hotel with free breakfast that was within walking distance of Disneyland for a four-person bachelorette trip. This hotel was perfect.ROOM: The hotel is an older property but it has been very well maintained and the hotel rooms have been updated recently with new counters and lighting fixtures. The bathroom sink/vanity was separate from the bathtub and toilet  which was great for getting ready in the morning. The beds are comfy (but we were also exhausted after spending our days in the park so I don't think it would've made a difference). There was a mini-fridge and microwave  both newer appliances. We asked for a room closer to the front of the property  which shaved about two minutes off our morning walks to get to the parks. It is not a fancy hotel but it is VERY well kept.LOCATION: The property is tucked away behind a Denny's and parking lot which means it does not get any of the main road traffic noise late at night. But once you get to the sidewalk  you can literally see the Disneyland welcome sign across the street. It is SO close  it takes just under 10 minutes to get to the security check right outside the parks. If you've got kids  the location is ideal for afternoon naps/breaks back at the hotel. Mind you it is located behind a parking lot with no divided walkway so keep watch your little ones keep away from cars driving through the parking lot/valet driveway. There's also a McDonald's  IHOP  other restaurants  and gift shops nearby.POOL/HOT TUB: We only used the hot tub one evening after spending all day walking in the park. It was a smaller hot tub but our group and a couple other guests managed to fit about eight people in there comfortably. It was nice to chat with other guests at the hotel who were clearly also Disney fans. Towels are available poolside.BREAKFAST: The breakfast room was adequate. There was cereal and milk  some fruits  muffins and pastries  juice and coffee. If you're a light breakfast person  it may be enough for you. We had some big breakfast people in our group and it just wasn't enough to sustain them for the early part of the day. If you just need some snacks before an actual sit-down breakfast later in the morning  it should be OK. But I wouldn't book this hotel just for the breakfast.All that said  I would absolutely book this hotel again in the future for another Disneyland trip.Thank you for your great review. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us! We hope you will visit again soon!,Positive

So I was delightfully surprised by the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. The interior designers did a great job appointing this facility. It was beautiful and well set up for a good night's rest. My only complaint (and this is negligible) is the background music. The ambient sounds being pumped into the atmosphere was an odd mix of drumbeats and birdsong and repetitive music -- it was like the hotel couldn't decide what atmosphere to shoot for.But all in all  the staff was courteous  the rooms were clean and comfortable  and the experience was overwhelmingly positive.Thank you for the feedback  I am really pleased that you had a restful stay with us.

She was so thorough  considerate - walked us through neighborhood map along with restaurant recommendations. Seeing that we were saying for a week  she gave was able to accommodate us by giving a room on the higher floors - 9th floor (which we thought was great attention to service). Was quite thirsty having just arrived  it was great to turn around to see there was free lemon water offered in the lobby! Really nice touch! We also found out later they offer complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings (in the lobby) too!Room met expectation - walked in and was quite pleased. Lovely room decor  nice designer lamps. Although we didn't use it  definitely a beautifully supplied fridge full of soft drinks/water and a nice minibar selection of drinks and snacks. Wifi access was really good! Compared to other hotels I've stayed at  Solamar's internet connection was pretty fast - therefore  more time to relax (instead of just sitting in front of the laptop waiting for page to be loaded). Size of tv was nice and larger than we normally are used to. Also  the remote control itself was CLEAN (meaning  no gunk stuck on it or anything of that sort).Bed itself was slightly on the hard side  though  by the time we finished our day  we were too tired and didn't mind that too much. Good thing was that the pillows were quite nice and soft. Bathroom: it was cool to have it as a sliding door (note: no lock). Amenities - good supply. Shampoo  shower and conditioner is not the mini-sized bottles  rather bottles which are mounted to the tub wall  so well lasts for days ahead. Good counter space where you can spread out all your things. The only thing to really say is about the sink itself. The sink has great visual appeal  though functionally  doesn't work too well  splatter water all over the counter because the sink sits on top of the counter rather than being curved down (if that makes any sense). So  always had to wipe down the counter each time after use.In all  clean modern hotel  which I definitely would be a place to return to for my next San Diego visit!Thank you for the great  and very thorough  review. I'm thrilled that Erika made such a good impression upon your arrival  she is very friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you for your stay with us and I'm glad we had a positive impact on your vacation.

Check in was quick and painless  and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh  it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view)  but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable  and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations  and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel  they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though  covering all types of cuisine  and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.,Positive

The trolley stops just a block away which is nice. Take a ride -- and see how close it comes to parked vehicles. Breakfast is always a treat  though Drury San Antonio had a wider variety of choices. And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings  baked potatoes  hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses  an attractive grocery  is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed  in my opinion  was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs  restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast.

After coming from another hotel where there were no issues  thy began to have allergic reactions. After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room  which they had to do since they would not refund the payment  but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here  that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again.

It's not the Hilton  but it was clean  friendly staff and  well  it was clean! Another big plus besides the awesome price was that there was no parking fee  which can be pretty costly. All in all  it's awesome overall value for where you are. Also worth mentioning  not sure if they are supposed to but they let us keep our vehicle in the parking garage for about an extra 5 hours after checkout  very cool!Thank you for staying with us and for your review.,Positive

Only 2-elevators and one was not working one day I was there. Only one goes to the parking garage. One day Breakfast was basically out of food by 8:30am  and it goes until 9:30. 45-min wait for a 1-egg omelet at the omelet bar. Rooms are very clean  showers are weak  but a nice size. Bed was good  towels were good. Nice to have a full kitchen even if I did not use it. TV selection is limited  less than most hotels. Rooms were very quiet  could not hear the street noise too much. Ask in advance if you want a view other than a Tram and Mc.Donalds. The Space Needle is on the other side. Overall if you can get a good rate  it's worth booking. No Room Service at this location.,Positive

The room was small but as we were only in San Francisco for 2 nights it worked nicely for us.

We were later moved to city view seventh floor. Breakfast was warm to cold. Wi fi on the other hand was very good. But not for 300. Edgewater is a little more but worth it.

1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes  so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there  so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough  you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle  EMP Museum  Chihuli Gardens  etc).We had a car  so it was nice to find plenty of parking  even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception  restaurant  housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly  regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them  but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal  yogurt with granola  fruits  etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However  the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat  assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant  both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines  regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads  Gouda cheese  prosciutto and good crackers  etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.,Positive

Had requested a high floor room  would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets  money  credit cards  passports  iPads etc with it being a long trip  told it was in the room. Got to the room  no safe  rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room  a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine  a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing  I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived  do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast  do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location  nice hotel  few niggles let it down,Positive

Its very covenient for the Moscone and although the room I had was quite small with not much view (just a regular Queen)  I felt that I didn't need any more room than that because it was so well-put together.

The continental breakfast the next morning was better than most. The issue is that some local hooligans decided to break into five cars Monday night around 10 p.m. I was promptly notified by the staff 15 minutes later that this occurred  and they have already called the police which was there in short order. The staff was courteous enough to vacuum the broken glass out of my front seat and help me bag the window to keep the elements out. Needless to say  I can't rate the sleep that I received on Monday night after being violated...because there wasn't any sleep. The day manager on Tuesday morning reviewed what limited video footage they had of the front door to no avail. I guess it's not their fault being Atlanta and all  but a 500 deductible still is 500 that I didn't want to spend to fix the glass and door frame. Well  there was a sign saying not responsible for vehicles left in the parking lot (right above my 2014 Truck) The parking lot was actually lit pretty well  I'd just expect full parking lot surveillance for us weary travelers. Yeah  you guys need to invest in cameras.Dear Aaron D First and foremost  on behalf of the Hampton Inn  I would like to express my sincerest apology for the inconvenience you experienced in respect to your car being broken into. I assure you that our hotel have taken steps to ensure that this issue has been addressed with our local CVB and police department. It is very sad that our hotel along with several other businesses have experienced similar incidents and it was not just isolated to the area. Unfortunately in this day and time with random acts of car break-ins all over Atlanta we have taken the necessary steps to prevent it from happening in the future. Thank you for letting us know that our team was accommodating and helpful.Once again we are truly sorry for your experience.Sincerely Patricia KilgoreGeneral manager,Positive

1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,IntroductionAs I looked out over Interstate 5 from my hotel room during rush hour  I felt somewhat justified in heeding the advice of more than a few Seattleites  who warned of the citys congested roadways  and voted in favor of its public transit alternatives. Allow me to draw the curtains  however  because this isnt about the sights and sounds of Seattle (lovely though it was)  but of the Springhill Suites  Marriotts 3-star offering located at 1800 Yale Avenue.ItineraryThe original plan was to take the link light rail from SeaTac airport all the way to Westlake Station  where I could then walk to my hotel of choice  the Westin. Since I had 50 000 Marriott Rewards points to spend  and would rather graduate to a 4-star hotel later in the week  I slightly altered the itinerary. After arriving and walking to the Westin  I found a taxi out front that whisked us (my girlfriend and I) nine blocks or so to the Springhill Suites. I believe the total cost of that trip was 7  including a tip. This was a somewhat nerve racking experience  as I wasnt sure how we would get to the hotel up until that point. More on that later.Lobby and Front DeskUpon entering the lobby  there were a few things to note. First and foremost the friendly staff  who provided room keys and a voucher for a complimentary item from their snack bar (or 200 Marriott Rewards points)  all while addressing me with a proper title and a smile. I know its their job  but Im a sucker for hearing my last name preceded by Mr.. The complimentary snack may have been a result of my status with Marriott (due to the points or my Marriott Rewards credit card). On the way to the elevators I glanced over at the bar/restaurant (appropriately titled Bistro on Yale Bar) and examined a lively scene of music and people that seemed to reflect the younger culture of Seattle. What I mean is that a large portion of the people I encountered throughout the city were either younger or around my age (Im 27 at the time of this review). Room Location and ViewThe view was nice  and about what I would expect from a 3-star hotel. It was located on the 8th floor  and Im not sure if this was to satisfy some preferred floor requisite in accordance with my entry level membership status. If so  it seemed strange that I was located next to the elevator and on the side without the coveted view of the space needle (like Id seen advertised). I wonder if Gold or Platinum status is necessary to net these luxuries without question  or a simple request to the front desk accompanied by 20. My view looked down on the 1811 Eastlake Avenue housing project  but also included the REI building  another building that displayed the time and temperature (very helpful when dressing)  and the freeway. The first of these was the most interesting  where I viewed two men casually smoking marijuana on the back patio (kind of a site when youre from one of the 46 contiguous states that have not legalized it).Room AmenitiesThe room itself appeared well kept and clean on entry. The peripheral furniture included a couch that turned into a fold-out  and a chair both were on the lower end of comfortable  but I wasnt expecting Hancock and Moore. As advertised  the room also included a mini refrigerator  microwave  coffee maker  and sink all the basics for an extended stay. They even threw in a few packets of tea and coffee (including decaf). Across from the kitchenette  and probably my favorite part of the whole room  was the office area. The desk was roomy enough to accommodate my laptop  power adapter  a few snacks  and the host of other things that had accumulated in my pockets throughout the day. The power socket on the lamp was also a simple yet appreciated feature. The best part  and the reason Ive wallowed on the office area this long  was the chair. I found myself able to sit for at least forty-five minutes comfortably. I wish I could say the same for the bed  which was a little too firm for my taste. After 8.5 hours of searching for the perfect position  the first morning was a little hazy. This restlessness wasnt limited to sleep  but also occurred while keeping my head at an 11:00 position to watch the televisionoddly situated in the space between the living area and bedroom. I see why they had to put it there  as the wall that led into the bedroom slanted inward into the bathroom area  but it still makes you wonder why the room was built this way. Speaking of  the toilet and shower were in a room across from the mirror and sink. A little peculiar  but both areas were clean. The hotel was also kind enough to purchase swiveling televisions (plasma  32-inch) to partially accommodate for the strange viewing angles. As I collapsed on to the fold out (yes  the fold out) after my first full day of touring  I questioned whether the floors consistency would be preferable to the charismatic springs in my back. Surprisingly  I slept better on this coiled chassis than the real bed. I can only assume it was due to the quality of the comforter (dense and fluffy)  my exhaustion from the night before  and the vast amount of walking that took place earlier in the day. Local AreaYou know the saying about real estate  and so does Marriott. Though 1800 Yale Avenue isnt in the heart of the city  the area in which its built has a distinct urban vibe that still offers plenty of comfort. I like convenience while traveling  so seeing a Subway across the street was a welcome assurance after a half-day spent walking around Microsofts campus. I did frequent this establishment more than once  but lest anyone accuse me of not absorbing the local food culture  I assure there was an undeniable flavor about the stores setup that merited multiple visits. The main eating area was quite large  to the point you could probably fit three to four regular-sized Subways in the space. There was also a hallway connecting this area to another equally-sized one (minus the ordering counter). Seating options varied from booths to round-tables (think Starbucks) and stool-tables. Also impressive was the lit fireplace near the round table I selected  which actually kept me warm. Come to find out  this space had been renovated by the owner to accommodate a local online retailer who would be occupying a number of floors above it in the future (you know them as Amazon). There was also a 24-Hour Fitness next door to Subway (and still across the street from the hotel). Nothing special there  except the complimentary guest access in addition to Springhill Suites own  smaller fitness room. This included the weight room and cardio areas  as well as the locker rooms and associated amenities. If weights or cardio arent your thing  the pool  sauna or steam room may still be worth checking out. The ShuttleBesides a room  what else did the Springhill Suites have to offer Did someone say free shuttle! But to whereand when I learned the answer to these two questions the hard way as I stood outside of Nordstroms after arriving at Westlake Center  overwhelmed by the incredible fall weather (central Texas gave up on the concept years ago). As much as I wanted to see Marriotts safe insignia whirl around the corner and transport me free of charge  the hotel representative I spoke with informed that the bus only ran until 9:00 PM. We had arrived at Westlake around 9:45  so we strolled among the yellowed leaves to the Westin for a taxi. **fast forward to the day of checkout** I glanced down from my window at the back alley  where I spotted the shuttle bus with its hood open. The driver was pouring fluid into one of the tanks  but I couldnt make out which fluid or tank. I consulted the front desk thirty minutes later to redeem a free shuttle ride back to Westlake Center  but was informed the bus was undergoing an oil change. I looked out the back window again to discover the hood had been closed and the driver had vanished. They called me a cab instead  and offered to refund the fare. I guess what Im trying to say is  I have no idea what the shuttle is like! All I can say is it exists  and it travels to Westlake Center and Seattle Center (according to the front desk patron). Food and DrinkOne of the sweeter alternative rock bands said  Some people drink Pepsi  some people drink Coke. In this hotel the assumption is the former  and you will find their vending machines on most floors (I checked while looking for a working ice machine)  as well as at the front snack bar. This drove my girlfriend nuts since she avidly consumes Diet Coke  and contributed to the aforementioned Subway visits. Im not sure if the the bar or breakfast area had alternatives  because I never went or had orange juice  respectively. Speaking of juice  the continental breakfast included eggs  bacon  sausage  biscuits  cereal  fruit  and an assortment of pastries. It was all pretty standard  and while Im not versed in the culinary arts  I would rate the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites a notch higher in quality. Still  free breakfast works for me! Business CenterLets delve into whats often thought of as the lobbys forgotten extension. This is the place that excites me most  partly because of my selected profession (IT)  and partly because of my general curiosity about how its handled. Before I get too entrenched  Id like to note that the wireless network in my room was open and unencrypted. A few questions entered my mind about thislike what would stop anyone in the area from leeching off the networkor anyone with a little technical sense from stirring up mischief (and by mischief I mean remotely browsing through your stuff) The possibilities are truly endless  and I would be remiss if I didnt urge you to get your digital house in order before connecting to this network (or any others like it).We can start with a basic question  something along the lines of What does the business center offer Well  there are two desktop computers and a printer  so you could check-in for your flight or print your boarding pass. Maybe you need to print out tickets for a local attraction or event. In some cases  you might even need to make an emergency purchase (pizza delivery if Subway is closed). That last situation brings up another questionthe one about feeling safe enough to enter your credit card number. While I did perform an extensive preliminary analysis to determine if vulnerabilities existed  the thing that probably concerns you most is the safety of your information. It should be stated that information is never 100 private  and with enough ingenuity and time anyone can probably get to it (obvious lecture concluded). Lucky for us  most people looking for a free lunch just dont want to work that hard. For those few criminal masterminds  however  dont make it easy!To give a brief overview  I was able to turn on cached internet files  history  auto-fill  and form data in Internet Explorer and Firefox. While there was a program for detecting spyware (Spybot)  there was no antivirus program present. I was also able to successfully boot from a live USB  which can potentially undermine many of the security measures put in place by Windows 7 (their OS of choice). On the plus side the firewall was on  the user account was not an administrator by default  and a program called Deep Freeze was installedwhich presumably removes all cached files between sessions. While some of these measures are good  it only takes one gaping hole to gain complete control of a machine. If there were a bottom line  it would be that personal or financial usage of these machines could make it easy.Fitness CenterNot too far down the hall exists the hotels own fitness center and swimming pool. I cant say much for the pool or hot tub since I didnt use them  but the fitness center contained two decent LifeFitness treadmills  one bike  one elliptical machine  and some free dumbbell weights. If the hustle and bustle (and meatheads) of the gym are too much for you  this modest area could be the perfect retreat to satisfy your cardiovascular or weight lifting needs. I would also like to note that right outside the fitness center is the nicest mens bathroom in the whole hotel. I said mens bathroom! I wont go into detail  but at this rate I imagine the womens restroom is actually a spa.Cleaning ServiceBefore leaving the Springhill Suites to downtown Seattles friendly  urban borders  lets talk about one last thing. While coming and going throughout our stay the staff were extremely pleasant  from the front desk clerks to the breakfast chefs. Even the maid was polite and cheery  something I found amazing. One strange thing  however  was that for the entire two-night stay no one cleaned our room. Im aware that some hotels offer a green option  where you choose not to have someone come in and clean in exchange for something like rewards points. To my knowledge this is not one of those hotels. We did hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door  but removed it when we left each morning. It wasnt a huge deal (as were relatively clean people)  but I imagine this could be an issue for say  a family of four with kids.ConclusionOverall I enjoyed my stay at the Springhill Suites  and would probably return if looking for a decent  3-star hotel in one of Seattles interesting pockets.

If you are looking for a taste of New Orleans with exposed brick and a lovely courtyard  this is the place. Only two things to be aware of...there aren't mini fridges or microwaves in the rooms. And the walls are kind of thin. I had no issue with noise whatsoever in my room  but my daughter had some slightly loud people next to her room. We did not take issue with that as you will have that anywhere you go.The Inn is within walking distance of everything and it's the only place we will be staying from now on.

This is a sad commentary  since we enjoyed the hotel last year  and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative  understanding  and friendly. But  the sink had only a trickle for water flow  and the engineer could not fix the problem. And  we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation  which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this  a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change  we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel  our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely  Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager,Negative

0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,On a recent business trip to New Orleans  I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so  I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome  about 1 mile away). The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in  I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy  yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops  restaurants  bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees  chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds  a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting  free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed)  a refrigerator  HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower  which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property  they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard  nearby buildings  the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool  I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options  including waffles  eggs  yogurt  cereal  etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests  a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets  which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening  the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks  but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape  and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers  the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans  I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean  comfortable  affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel  I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You  Bryant Faul - General Manager,Positive

Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK  however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less . I could have stayed 2 nights at a Hilton/Hampton for what I paid 1 night for at Marriott.Lilac Creating a Brilliant Experience is our top priority and we apologize for missing that mark during your stay.

Imagine our disgruntlement to find that the room had not been serviced and that the only towels in the room were the wet ones we left in the tub to indicate to housekeeping that we wanted fresh ones for the second night. The Courtyard Atlanta Midtown/Georgia Tech had always been our lodging of choice prior to this experience and we have never had any complaints while here. Probably better to not reiterate our mistake.,Negative

The carry Aveda products in the bath  so that was a nice touch. It was also close to several shopping centers and restaurant options. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was hair in several different places in my bathroom. It still seemed very clean  but definitely a let down to find that. I would stay here again at that price.I am very sorry for the way in which you found your room. I will review with my Housekeeping Manager and follow up.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,I found this hotel on Trip Advisor. I knew I wanted a place with some character  something New Orleans. This was it.I've never loved a room as much as I loved our room at the French Market Inn. We had a deluxe balcony room (249)  and our balcony was right over Decatur. It was a huge balcony  more of a terrace  maybe 12 feet wide and very very long we shared it with the room next door. On the other side was a restaurant balcony  but it was cool weather and people were not dining on the balcony.The room was very spacious  had very high beamed ceilings  a good sized bathroom with walk in shower  high end finishes  good linens  good mattresses  good beds. There was a party getting set for the next night so some very loud bands practicing  but the management assured us they would shut down around 8 p.m. which they did. We got to sit out on the terrace and listen to the Steamboat Natchez give a calliope concert  we got to watch the sound and light crews work into the wee small hours setting up for the New Year's / Sugar Bowl Party. The hotel itself has a variety of rooms in four or five different buildings  all together around a small central courtyard with a pool. It is full of character it is romantic.The hotel is in the middle of everything happening. You can shop in the big stores over at Canal Street One  or you can browse through the French Market  steps away  by Jackson Square. Go around the corner and up the street  and you hit Chartres  Royal and Bourbon Streets  where the party never stops. We loved our stay in this hotel  and we loved our room. Although it was well soundproofed  we still heard the occasional boom box car and the occasional emergency vehicle. The terrace was a great people-watching and activity watching site  a great place to drink coffee and soak in some atmosphere  but next time we will probably opt for a courtyard balcony room  and get a little more sleep.We're happy to hear your enjoyed your time with us in New Orleans  and appreciate you taking the time to share your valuable feedback. Thank you for your kind words about our accommodations and central French Quarter location - we look forward to welcoming you back to the Big Easy soon!,Positive

It is across the street from the Seattle Center therefore the Space Needle  Pacific Science center  the Armory  EMP  Museum of Pop Culture  Artists Playground  etc. are very easy to get to. The rooms are suites. It seems the ones facing the Space Needle (01-10) are more spacious or the layouts seems more spacious. I had family in a 19 room  which was a corner and it had the same features but a smaller table/island and living space. The suites are well supplied with everything you would need and the front desk is more than happy to give you extra supplies.The staff at this hotel is excellent. They are accommodating and very considerate. They call it a continental breakfast but I think it is significantly better than that. It has several hot food options  which change everyday and there is a always an omelet bar. In your room  there is a note with the rush hours for the free breakfast. It is pretty accurate. They also have a great happy hour and coffee is always available downstairs. For picky kids or late night eats or when the Armory is already closed  there is a 24 hour drive thru McDonalds.The only issue I had with the location was the parking garage. The spaces are tight. and you are assigned a space when you check in. The garage is underneath the hotel (which is convenient) but to drive in and out you have to use a special garage key. However  with the monorail across the street you probably do not need car.,Positive

It was within walking distance of bone fish grill and a short drive from a bunch of other cool restaurants.Some reviews had mentioned construction noise which worried me initially  but we stayed there on a Friday and Saturday night and didn't hear a thing.

The Pool and spa were dirty and I got an attitude when I asked for pool towels. The evening social was a disappointment from what we have experienced from other Homewood Suites and the breakfast was lacking as well. The room was fine  a little outdated but the AC would turn on and off by itself and was really loud. One if the elevators broke down while my family was in it  luckily we were able to get out. This hotel is close to everything you want to do in the area  but i feel there may be a better choice somewhere else. We have had more than a few bad stays with the Hilton Brand lately. Not sure if I will continue being a Hilton Honors member. To top it all off  I wrote a review from the Trip Adviser link on my emailed receipt and it never got published. Not happy.,Negative

We had a nice stay at the Dream Inn in Santa Cruz (another Joie de Vivre property) and the Galleria Park was offering a weekend special with free parking  so we decided to give it a shot. Man  what a great surprise!The hotel is in a great location on Sutter Street  just a block from Kearny and a few blocks from Market. Union Square is a short walk away  as is China Town  and there is incredible shopping and dining everywhere you turn. One night we ate at the very hip and trendy Farmerbrown Restaurant  and another night at the French seafood bistro Plouf. Public transit is steps away  so within minutes you can easily get all over the city.The hotel is beautifully decorated with a great chandelier hanging in entry  a huge decorative fireplace in the corner  great art throughout  a very cool terrace on the third floor and even a nice wine happy hour.The room was very comfortable with plenty of space. It was a typical old San Francisco building with steam heat  but lots of charm and all the new amenities you could ask for.

It is the old Radisson Hotel that has just had a massive upgrade. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is bright and airy. The courtyard outside is excellent of an evening with lovely places to sit and games for kids and adults. In the reception area  again is a lovely large area for people to chill out and the games room is again for kids and adults alike. The rooms and big  very comfortable and the beds some of the best i have had in a hotel. However  the bathroom falls down for me. You have a mssive bathroom and no shelf space to put toiletries or even the bathh towels which are kept in the wardrobe. There is so much space to put a few small shelves the bathroom is just wasted. Again in the shower area there rae no shelving at all to hang toiletries. The bathhroom door again is a massive negative and be very careful closing it from the inside as the handles are so close to the edge you will catch your fingers.The bathroom is just a small negative for me as it we stayed in San Francisco again we would definately stay here. It's dissapointing there isn't a small bar area or breakfast area but again that is very minor as you have Johnny Rockets attached to the hotel that is more than suitable for breakfast.Overall a very good hotel right on Fishermans Wharf with just a few minor irritations and we would 100 stay here again.Hi Davek200000 Thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay at Zephyr!Yes  we had a massive upgrade! 32 million were spent to create our new phenomenal hotel!I am so glad to hear you were able to enjoy all the fun offerings we have between our game room and our yard!

1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise)  very well appointed  had a nice whirlpool type jet tub  and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice  had some character  and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However  it was a few blocks from most of those attractions  which I didnt mind  but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs  waffles  bagels  etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory  but nothing off the charts. Hey  but this was all free  so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense  based on observations at various times during my midweek visit  this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity  I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete  that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all  I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.,Positive

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Hotel rooms in Seattle in the summer are beginning to rival San Francisco in price  so I was pleased to find a Living Social promotion for this place that extended into May. I was pleasantly surprised to find that many of the criticisms about this place by other travelers were exaggerated. We chose a private bath (because I just dont like sharing a bath)  but the shared bath facilities looked quite nice and never apparently completely full. We were on the second floor overlooking Ballard Ave.  and the weather was relatively warm  but the room cooled off quite well without air-conditioning and the noise level  even on a Saturday night with windows open  was not a problem. Local bars apparently dont have live music and the people watching from our window was endlessly entertaining. By 1 a.m.  the place was as quiet as could be and with the windows closed  noise is not a problem  at all any time of the day. The Ballard farmers market every summer Sunday is literally right outside the front door of the hotel  providing more people watching entertainment in the morning while we drank our complimentary coffee and also providing several inexpensive brunch opportunities. Parking in and getting ice from the neighboring hotel was as simple as could be and not the burden some other travelers have reported.Two previous criticisms are valid: the windows should have screens  and the first-floor rooms dont feel very secure if you need to open the windows for cooling  but they would be perfectly fine any time of year but summer. Despite that  this place is a super value  even at full price. Rooms are very nice the neighborhood is trendy (in a good way) and the location is a short drive to Seattle Center or downtown. I would definitely stay here again..,Positive

0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed  clean  and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many  many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square  we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction  so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said  Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.,Positive

Only complaints about the room are lack of a comfortable chair and the dresser. The dresser is in the closet and is difficult to access which is annoying during a long stay.

It was a great choice! The elevators were fast (good for a claustraphobic like me!)  our suite was roomy and had all the conveniences we needed  and the view of the river  the street below and the amazing architecture around us was outstanding! Other than taking the Metra one day to the Museum of Science and Industry  we walked everywhere. There were more restaurants  shopping and theatres close by than we could ever visit in one trip. I felt totally safe at all times  and having a 7 Eleven just a few doors down was so convenient. I definitely recommend this hotel for families because of the washer and dryer  full kitchen and space. We had a large walk-in closet along with two smaller closets  and the living space was very spacious  even with two beds. Being in the middle of the shopping district and the park was great! All of the staff that we encountered were courteous  friendly and helpful. The parking was not a big deal (that actually was my biggest worry). We simply turned the car over to the attendant at the Hard Rock Hotel. We carried our bags ourselves to and from the hotel (a half block walk). The cost of parking is high  but it is everywhere in downtown. It did look like the self-parking lot was only a block further from the hotel  and we probably would use that next time  since we carried our own luggage anyway. (It's a lot cheaper) We did not move our car the whole time we were there  since everything was either within walking distance or the train.Dear smokemom Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review.

Very nice rooms and include a full kitchen. The hotel has great decor and friendly staff. Location is good. Although not in downtown it is surprisingly close (walking distance) and from there one can take the monorail to attractions such as the space needle. Hotel has a pool  gym and a game room  although we found the pool to be a bit small and somewhat murky. The breakfast is continental and very basic (like you would find in most other hotels) and the WiFi  although free  was quite slow.Dining: There are a few restaurant across the street  near the bay  they are good for a quick bite but I did not find them to be very impressive. You can get to the business district via short walk and they have more choices.Overall I would recommend the stay if the price is right. I would entitle this hotel with top marks is they had something better than average like the pool  wifi or restaurant. It just falls slightly short of the 5* mark.Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay in Seattle.

This hotel looks like a city block with no curb appeal but don't be dissuaded--all the charms start with the valets and continue inside! The sleek lobby with fireplace is spacious and provides several areas for conversation and an adjacent lobby bar is a busy spot to watch a game on TV or get a bite to eat. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful especially when we wanted to mail packages home. The efficient valets were on the ball every minute to store/retrieve your car (22.00/night)  flag a cab  or arrange a shuttle to the downtown areas. Luggage carts are available at the point of entry. The engineer of the hotel offered to fix our luggage handle which was broken by the airline and it was done in minutes  cheerfully! The rooms are very spacious  the desk is roomy and has a good work light and even the desk chair was comfortable on rolling castors. Earth tones of grey and soft green walls were subdued and restful. Comfortable bed  above average linens and lots of great pillows. Sitting area had two floor lamps and was very ample with a nice firm sofa and two chairs. Everything was clean and updated  spotless sink area and toilet/bath room. Despite its location near the interstate our room was quiet. The daily breakfasts in the dining room were a full-service hot buffet for an additional nominal fee  efficient  welcoming staff  and no waiting. The Springhill Suites staff seems genuinely happy to serve patrons and we are appreciative for their helpfulness and suggestions  making this hotel feel like a home away from home.Reviews like this absolutely make my day -- there's nothing better than to hear we could be a bright spot and a comfort while someone was on the road.

It did suffice as we were leaving for a cruise that morning  and the friendly hotel staff helped us set up a shuttle.Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding your recent stay with us!

All have beautiful food and great ambience. The pool is good and clean and of course you are literally on the beach which is a lot quieter than at the main Waikiki beach. The Boardwalk shops and restaurants are a few minutes walk away and have a great selection of shopping. Recommend these restaurants - Cheeseburgers  Ruth Chris Steakhouse  P F Chang as well as hotel restaurants.

I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot  cigarette burns on the floor  dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded  which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible.

We stayed at the Limited Edition Ramada Inn on Lombard  down on the wharf. Clean and fairly quite accomodations. The man at the front was extremely nice though.Explored the wharf at night and in the day and thought it was fantastic. Did a trip to Alcatraz. If you haven't been I suggest a trip there. Beautiful and full of so much history. Nice day trip. As I said already didn't get much else in but that. For sure requires more time than we had to commit to..,Positive

0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,We stayed as part of a group. Price was very affordable and a good value for the stay. The entire hotel was very clean. I remember the bathroom being slightly aged but it was nothing to ruin our stay. Our room was a king bed  a nice size with view facing window. The window curtain was just long enough to cover the AC which would have otherwise directly blown on us  and allowing the room to cool to the right temp. The lobby is very charming  with amenities such as snacks and drinks to purchase immediately adjacent to the front desk  and a little cafe and lots of seating. The pool and hot tub are nice  very clean  and a decent size. The lounge chairs are a little overcrowded but there's plenty of seating. It's in walking distance to many shopping centers  delis  coffee shops  and grocery.You'll need your room key to get anywhere within the hotel  including back inside from the pool area.Only complaint is that the advertised check-in time is 4PM which is late. Thankfully we asked if we could get in earlier and a room was ready.The staff - everyone we saw - was wonderful  kind  and professional. We would have loved to have stayed another night.Great for families  couples  and groups.,Positive

Historic photographs  views of the skyline. It was just awesome.- Nice locations near the Public Gardens and walkable to restaurants and attractions- The building felt historic and full of characterNegatives:- The parking situation was absolutely awful. Parking was only available at the Boston Common garage for a fee of 30-something a day  which isn't so bad  but the distance from the hotel is very far and in an underground garage. This really detracted from the overall experience and we wouldn't recommend it to others that have driven a car to the hotel. I would say stay at this hotel if you do not have a car with you.- Hotel staff were average  we did not feel welcomed by any of them.- The breakfast was poor - low quality food and some cheap automatic coffee maker,Positive

The complimentary breakfast had a lot to offer - fresh fruit  waffles  scrambled eggs  sausage patties  yogurt were only some of the items available. There's also a complimentary happy hour with food  but we were out about. The rooms were nice - the beds suited us  there was a small refrig the shower was OK. An appreciated detail was that there are an abundant number of outlets throughout the room. If driving  it's not too far off the I-10 hotel parking is valet only.,Positive

We got a great deal and the room was beautiful. The hotel property is well maintained and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The courtyard/pool are lovely.The location was perfect for us. It is only three block from Bourbon Street and the entire French Quarter and Garden District are both within walking distance. The breakfast was great! Sometimes when you hear continental breakfast you think stake doughnuts and bad fruit - this was not the case here. Each day had eggs  breakfast meat and bread or potatoes. In addition fruit  yogurt  toast  bagels  waffles  coffee  juices and water were available. We liked to start our day with breakfast at the hotel while we reviewed our plan for the day. It also helped cut down on our food costs.My only suggestion - if you have a room on the first floor bring a fan. The noise from the courtyard can travel and if you are a light sleeper this might be a problem for you.,Positive

A strategic location  close to the cable car route and very Uber friendly.The hotel as cozy but all you really need if you intend to see the city. It is in an older building so the AC/heater units are pretty old... the one in my room was a noisy little thing but it worked well.I didnt do much but sleep there so it suited my needs. Review their fees carefully before reservations. If using a third party to book  they may not make hidden charges apparent.Clean and convenient.,Positive

I recommend renting a car and doing little day trips  but no matter what  there's nothing like the Vagabond pool vibe. I could live here!!SO gald you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you back at the Vagabond soon. We changed our policy of no children under 13 earlier this year and we have more families now staying with us and enjoying the pool and the floaties !,Positive

When I made the reservation  it was not specified which section my room would be in. I guess I ended up booking a room in the Annex part  which was obviously falsely advertised. They must use the picture from their nicer rooms to advertise because this room was a piece of crap. Crumbs on the floor  chewed gum on the bed headboard  lineoleum sink top was peeling off  dresser drawers were broken  and dust everywhere. Thumbs wayyyy down!,Negative

The rooms were of a nice size and layout was good. They are a preferred Hotel to Sea World and have some nice added benefits. Quick Que for one . Since we were going to spend the day at the theme park  we received 3 passes for the Quick Que free with our stay. That saved us 60 at the park and lots of time in lines at the rides.

The hotel was ideal for us. Although at check in we were disappointed our booked room (a King Bed Suite) wasn't available  the substitute suite with 2 Queen beds was very acceptable. Rooms were very modern with a fully equipped kitchen and sofa bed in the sitting room and en suite off the bedroom. Maid service excellent and the room was spotless. In room safe very roomy and easy to operate. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning - fruit juice  cereal  toast  muffins  bagels  preserves  cream cheese  eggs  bacon or sausages  most days hash browns  fruit (apples  oranges bananas) and our favourite - waffles. Didn't try the Manager's Reception. Particularly liked the card entry system that let you in to the room and also the leisure areas and extra doors from the car park. Several lifts round the hotel also made room access easy. Excellent value for money.,Positive

I thought our patio door was cracked or broken letting in so much noise. I looked into changing hotels within hours of arriving. There is nothing extra about this hotel: soda machine outside in parking area. Room was very small. The two of us had a hard time with having a spot to keep suitcase. Not sure what a larger party would do with the space. Fridge and Microwave in room were nice. Breakfast room was small and always crowded but the food was good. My son loved the waffles.

If you'd rather walk  just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur  each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small  as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful  with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite  and it had tons of space  although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa  and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom  so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access  but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed  two night stands with lamps  entertainment center with television  telephone  and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa  chair  recliner  coffee table  entertainment center with television  refrigerator  and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided)  and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet  as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day  which is a bargain. The lot is self-park  no valet  so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area  to use the elevators  and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans  and our first stay at the Drury.

There was just one thing that was wrong and it is not a fault of this hotel alone. During the night the guests in the next room arrived back in and conducted a very loud conversation. The sound proofing between the rooms was non existent. I am sure this hotel was built during the 70's or the 80's and has since been refurbished  at this stage the sound proofing should have been improved.

Customer service was very good  location was excellent near seaport village and just across the street from Midway 41 Museum. Breakfast was included in our package and it was very good.

A welcome beverage was served to cool off from the summer heat. The room was super comfortable and incredibly clean but the balcony was very small(just large enough to stand on but no room for furniture of any kind). Other than that  i have not one complaint about this hotel. Some if miami's highest rated restaurants are in the hotel as well as the amazing spa. Tried to top my hubby by booking at the biltmore for his birthday but they dropped the ball on several aspects. The mandarin is definitely the way to go.,Positive

Lots of bars within a 1 block walk. Tip 2: parking is 44 per night. Might want to take train in (several stops nearby).Thank you for being our guest at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown.

It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed  done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018 Thank you for taking the time to review our property.

Luxury king bed room is so spacious with the biggest LCD TV I ever seen in a 5* hotels. Very comfortable bed so you can sleep like a baby.

Huge about 6 m long bathroom with the mirror allover the wall. Separate walk-in rainy shower and separate WC. Luxury bathroom amenities. Digital touch everywhere in the room. WiFi is free of charge. What I found as disappointed is breakfast..if you want buffet breakfast the chosen food are so poor...just eggs and bacon  some sweets...nothing else for 26 USD!!!. Really shame. Try to have breakfast somewhere else.Dear Nikac  Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and taking time to write about your experience.

This are the kind of notes and review that I'm joyfully writing...A review about a great hotel...A hotel that holds a soft spot in our impenitent travelers hearts...A place that we missed a lot as we haven't been in Miami in sometime...Finally we had motive to drive down from our North Orlando home to Miami Jose Carlos  one of our dearest godsons that live and works there  was getting marry last August. As soon as we had that great news I planned-as I usually do- a mini Gastrotour not only in Mia  but in Palm Beach as well. Later on our planned road-tour and Gastrotour suffered alterations Rafa  husband of Angui our oldest daughter  needed a hip surgery and it was scheduled on those days. When we go to Miami we always stay in a place that we love:The Mandarin Oriental Hotel ! We made our reservations for the wedding-way ahead of time- using as a first time the TripAdvisor hotel reservations system linked to Booking.com. I'm obliged to mention that we got  via TA  excellent rates at the Mandarin  were we planned to stay just for 3 days  bur plans changed and we needed to stay one day at Miami's Doral area  were Rafa had its hip surgery. With those changes we needed to check in at the Mandarin one day before our TA scheduled reservation and this is just part of this review framed on the moments lived on those days. As we  my wife and myself  were driving into that nice Brickell's Ave areas  passed Brickell and had that magnificent views at Mandarin behind the bridge that connects mainland to Brickell Key...we felt-literally- like arriving in Paradise. That's are our wholeheartedly tender feelings towards the area and a hotel place that holds a soft spot in our hearts ! At Lobby and reception areas we felt like home and no-different was treatment at our arrival...needing to check-in a day previous to our reservation. After we explained the reception staff-courteous  proper and friendly as ever- that we are olde regular costumers in need to check in that day  they were helpfully at getting us one of their very best Rooms  within quality reserved  Room 1815 located on 18 th floor with the most splendid views to Biscayne Bay and those beautiful Southwestern water Seas  great by day  but even greater by Miami multicolored lights night That views are just part  as well  of the myriad of details that makes The Mandarin...a paradise found ! Before going on some details of our fantastic renovated experience there  I'm obliged to note that being a Hotel Developer and Owner  being professional Architect specialized in Resorts and Hotels designs and being a high end traveler all my life with a very clear understanding on hotel management and meanings of their offerings and designs...In can  professionally and humanly  asserts that the Mandarin Oriental  in Brickell Key  has what a great hotel needs certain style in its attractive design elegance and distinction  warmth and intimacy in the architecture and its deco design and architectural layout  which is not boxed into standards  offering a different theme in hospitality  from entranced areas to guest-rooms to facilities...making every single stay in it a unique experience ! Those are qualities  together with personalized Services and Building maintenance  of paramount importance to defined a property as a Grand Hotel  but lets have a look at some of it: Location in that Chic Miami areas is great just steps from Brickell Ave and a renovated Downtown areas  and others prime Miami areas with easy driving distances to archifamous Miami Beaches and those in historic Coral Gables Exterior image. With its masterwork architectural design...Its an attraction  as a building  itself majestically sited on the best corner of Brickell Key Reception is simply a work of art. Rather chic and perfectly designed with its very high ceiling  bottom to ceiling panoramic glasses  furniture and deco details (including a mural size artwork of Urea Rib a famous dominican painter)  elegant front desk with proper done human-scale details with includes an always nice welcoming cold tea beverage... ....while you are at AW  with the most splendid paradisiac views ! Guests Facilities. Those areas are perfect and offering everything needed and more to be qualified as a luxurious Five Star Hotel: The Mandarin hosts two of Southwest best fine restaurants: AZUL and La Mar by Gaston Acurio a prestigious latin chef  native of Peru  is a fantastic new addition at Mandarin with his superb Peruvian and LatinAmerican recipes (reviewed independently). At Azul we were happily and friendly greeted by one of their Servers that knos us very well  from our previous visits...since Michell Berstein was in charge of their kitchen...which is still doing a great work ! Besides that they added a perfect and needed area to bring up more live to their large Lobby in the manner of MO- Bar Lounge. Nice and chic with great views  better drinks and light snacks  but pleasing to all discerning foodies and either a perfect meeting place or to have sunset drinks and Champagnes...or after dinner digestifs. All restaurants has a clever architectural design  as self standing ones  allowing independence between Hotel Guests and gastro-restaurant goers. The Mandarin SPA offers an ultimate luxury Spa experience from a variety of therapeutic treatments that we enjoyed several times over the years. We considered it as one the greatest Spa in US due to their highly trained therapist that can work the needs of each individual Guests Facilities. Among others they had niceTerraces right next to the crystal waters  swimming pools and exterior leisure areas just for guests Meeting areas and Events. They are well located meeting and event areas as we can noticed with independent access and services...as good as they can be. We never had used  but as hotelier I did notice their users pleased and comfortably going up and down by the elevators Their Concierge service  as always  was fantastic and helpful. We love to find that they keep staff with such a great work attitude Staff. In hotels  as in any other large Business in Service to costumers  service is of paramount importance  but that comes from a vertical command in which every and each part of that chain knows its duties Service to Costumers before all with faithful and neat behavior in and out and above their service hours...as they are trained here in all departments  at Mandarin. Last  but not the least important: Rooms at Mandarin are one of its strongholds they are FANTASTIC. We loved our great latest room on floor 18th with it great views and all its multiple details distribution  siting areas  great bedding and comfort  great deco  furniture and ambiance. Besides they- Mandarin Hotel- were one of the firsts fine hotels introducing the semi-opened bathrooms...making it  for architect and art lovers souls- like mine- a very special feeling of innovation  freshness and well-being. This time- fir different reasons- we did not reserved (as usual) their Executive high floor Rooms...our favorites there (besides their great Suites)  but their management and staff attentions were above and beyond any expectations ... ....on that- our 25th stay- there: At our arrival we received a beautiful basket arrangement with Fruits  Cheeses and Champagne  but better than that was the nice note from Mrs Bustamante  welcoming us -back again- to our beloved Mandarin !Every and each one of those myriad of details at Mandarin Oriental Hotel could be overlooked by others  but not by us......as discerning high end travelers and Hotel Owners ! ...and that's why we keep this hotel in a very soft spot in our hearts ...and that's why my dear wife asked me Antonio lets stay one more day...with no-words needed thats why we stayed there a couple of more fantastic days ! hoping to be back as soon as we can !,Positive

When we arrived  being Platinum  they offered us the opportunity to stay in a 3rd floor balcony room. What was also impressive is they alerted us in advance that it would be noisy and gave us the option to take a courtyard room. We decided  not getting to NOLA often  to get stay in the balcony room. We had a great view of the passers by and street entertainment all night and it was great that as we got hungry we could just walk out of the hotel and within a few blocks are some really good restaurants. We were there on a Sunday night and the drums were pounding loudly until 4 am. I learned two things from it 1) this hotel room came equipped with two sets of earplugs (which we did not use) and 2) I was so tired I slept ok even with all the noise.To sum up  very good staff  great location  good value. It is true that a Bourbon street-side room is not for everyone. If loud noise most of the night is a big problem  just ask for a courtyard room. But is you want the unique view of Bourbon Street  the balcony rooms give you the best view in the city. If you use the earplugs or noise cancellation  you will be fine.Thank you Havasupai123 for providing your feedback on your stay with us. We are so pleased to hear you and your son enjoyed your Bourbon balcony room. We greatly appreciate the perfect score.

The parking was free  which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly  many of the cars are double-parked  which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out  we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee  tea bags  hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old  the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place. If you're looking for a cheap hotel in Downtown SF  this place is ok  just don't expect much.,Negative

They also assisted me with my luggage and were incredibly friendly and helpful with pointing out the hotel restaurants and amenities along the way to my room. The grounds are incredibly gorgeous- flowers  succulents  and greenery galore! While the property is quite spread out  I found that getting from my room to the other side of the property never took more than 3-5 minutes. The room was spotless and the pillows and bedding were far superior to even my own at home! I can't tell you what a comfortable night's sleep I had! The spa is small but tranquil with a friendly  helpful staff. The pricing for services was actually pretty reasonable compared to many hotel spas- a 50 minute massage starts at 115.

The only advantage of the continuously loud  throbbing dance music is that it drowns out the traffic noise from the street. I  too  was suckered by the glowing reviews  but in reality  this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town  and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls  making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar  which unfortunately is in an open courtyard  which means you get to hear the music all night  whether you want to or not. The crowd is young  as is the staff. If you are  too  and are on vacation  you might like this place. But don't stay here for business.,Negative

We have been staying at the Waverly for many years and it is always A+. It's beautiful and conveniently located for shopping and dining. The beds are very comfy too. We feel safe here. Two little things- better ventilation in the bathroom for steam and people slam those heavy doors. I guess that can't be helped as I believe the doors must be like that for fire regulations. Overall great trip and we will be back!,Positive

I did notice that our room's bathroom fan was falling off the ceiling and notified the team. We were told maintenance would come look at it and take care of it. Well during our entire week there  it was not fixed. Not a big issue  just looked unprofessional. We also noticed our hair dryer holder from the wall was coming off. Breakfast menu is ok. Hot food changes every other day: scrambled eggs gravy with biscuits  scrambled eggs sausages. Lots of variety but after our third day...nah. Walking distance to International Drive  close to lots of gift shops and restaurants. Pool wasn't as clean  workout room was small and all old equipments (really need to upgrade)  has a little snack shop by lobby  elevators are slow old and shuttle bus was good.

Had a room with 1 king bed. Never got back in the car after we checked in due to the close proximity to everything including the cable car lines. The best part was the staff. Nancy at the front desk was awesome helped so much. The rest of the staff seemed like family. Will definitely stay again the next time I go to New Orleans. The only negative was the high price of parking. I recommend you valet park because the public lot across the street is high on weekends goes from 42 a day to 57.We're happy to hear you had a great experience at the French Market Inn! Thank you for sharing your feedback about our service - staff members like Nancy work hard to ensure great guest experiences happen every day.

The service was warm and friendly. The room was very clean with a king size bed  mini fridge  microwave  iron  ironing board  hair dryer and tv. I was on the second floor and it was mostly quiet with minimal noise from the road. They offer a hotel pool and hot tub which is clean and well maintained. The location is close to shopping (a car is a must) and the wineries. I found a gem of a grocery just across the street called Vallergas where I could get a salad from the salad bar for lunch!,Positive
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,Driving into the small parking lot of the hotel  I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11  too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included) . The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room  so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes  sausages  eggs  different breads and muffins  cereal  yogurt  granola  fruit  almond milk  teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did  maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again.

We chose this particular hotel because of it's proximity to Citizens Park (10 minutes away). We were greeted warmly at the front desk and by all of the housekeeping staff. The only suggestion I have is regarding the breakfast the eggs were a little weird (they tasted ok but they looked fake) and there should probably be more than one waffle maker to eliminate a long wait time. We will continue to choose Hampton Inns for our future trips and will definitely stay at this particular hotel the next time we attend a Phillies (or Flyers) game.Thank you for your kind words and feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport.

You get free in-room wi-fi (or free 20mins if you use hotel computers) and free use of a nice roof terrace.

After all was said and done the first time  the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly.

We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums  and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards  but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags  and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street  a busy thoroughfare  we expected some noise and on the first night  which coincided with a Saints NFL game  we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many  many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

The shuttle will take you to the airport where you can get septa (public transportation) to go downtown or any point you want. John was a really friendly driver and the vans even have complimentary bottled water. The hotel itself is typical Fairfield but has recently been updated to the newest color combos. Breakfast is super which definitely makes Fairfield an outstanding value. There is a Ruby Tuesday right across the street for a quick dinner without getting back in the car. We've yet to have a bad experience with Marriott which is why they remain our preferred brand.Hello Thank you for your feedback. We would love for you to come back and stay with us when you return.

Rooms are a bit noisy and you can hear others' in hallways and in adjacent rooms. The only perk is the free breakfast  which is just okay.The thing that really bothered me about this property was the shuttle service. So  they advertise they have shuttle service  but if you don't tell the front desk at least a half day ahead of time they tell you that they ain't got you down on the shuttle log and they act like they are doing you a favor to get a ride back to the airport on the top of the hour. Hello! Take a customer service class or don't advertise free shuttle service!Thank you makling the Fairfield Inn/ Marriott  we are unpleased that your stay with us was not enjoyable. However  thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. We strive to ensure that our service is pleasing to our guest. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.

I'll be staying here again.Thank you for taking the time lto let us know how your stay was. We're glad everything was a 'check'. We look forward to see you soon!Thys JonesGeneral Manager,Positive

Our trip started off with the lady who picked us up at the airport  she kind and courteous. Our room was clean and well maintained for the entire stay. Each morning we ate breakfast downstairs. The breakfast bar had options that would satisfy the pickiest of eaters. The front desk associates were very helpful in explaining how to use area public transportation. This hotel is close to the SEPTA train station and bus stop. When we return to Philadelphia we will stay at this hotel.,Positive

Always within walking distance of where we needed to be. I loved hearing the calliope on the steamship in the evening. The staff was always friendly  courteous and greeted us by name. The room was very comfortable. We had a king sundeck room. But our outdoor table and chairs were missing so we didn't get the chance to sit outdoor and just chill. The other 3 sundeck rooms had the table and chairs. Breakfast was average but at least it was there and available in the morning. I wish we had more time to spend in New Orleans. Now  at least I know where to book our room next time we visit. I would definitely book Bienville House again.We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at Bienville House and took the time to share your great experience with TripAdvisor. It sounds like the perfect trip! Please return soon to Bienville House for another great trip!,Positive

While the decor could use some updating  our overall stay was excellent.It was quiet and the breakfasts are very good. Hats off to Josh the manager and Stephanie our hostess. Maybe they can upgrade bath amenities and their general decor. Orange based decor is out folks! New rugs and suite rooms would be a nice change.However  every staff person was helpful and our room was quiet and lovely. They do listen to ones requests!Ask the front desk for the lust of local restaurants  it is helpful.Breakfast is excellent. A real plus.We will be back next year.I would like to sincerely thank you for your loyalty to our hotel. Your feedback is appreciated and necessary for our hotel to improve. I will be sure your comments get in the right hands. Josh and Stephanie were delighted to hear your feedback. We cannot wait to have you back soon!,Positive
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights  arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid  and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location  partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought  and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October  the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined  and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account  I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again  and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid  which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay)  which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here  has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking  as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces  given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel  rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair  leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western  let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced  though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel  when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed  but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally  on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which  in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid  could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that  though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92  and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive  that is the hotels risk. After all  they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system  and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines  so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill. I do heartily apologize for the disappointment in our hotelMelissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net,Negative

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Planned last 4 nights of a month long vacation for this property. Wanted some quiet space to just relax  organize for the trip back home. Called ahead to confirm would have room with good view as planned to spend time in room enjoying. Terribly disappointed when arrived (Fri - 5 PM) to look out to view of street and parking lot. Immediately asked for another room -- they refused to change as said they were going to be full -- but it was obvious many many had not checked in yet -- could have changed  but did not want to bother. Furnishings were dingy  room hot - had to replace thermostat in room second day returned to room one evening after long day in city to find room had not been cleaned. Just over all - not what you expect as a loyal Marriott Rewards member. Do not recommend this property.,Negative

0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,My wife and I recently stayed at this property for 3 nights and had a fabulous stay! The location is just a few miles south of the Orange County/Los Angeles County line. You could not ask for a better location all around! The hotel is about a half mile off of I-5 and is right across the street from Angels Stadium. One night we walked from our room to the stadium and made it there in a couple of minutes. I was a bit nervous that traffic might be bad around game time as fans are coming in but I was surprised to see no traffic at all. Disneyland is located about 1-2 miles away. The staff was nice enough to tell us a shorter way over to Disney and we were in the parking lot in under 5 minutes. The staff is top notch! I have never met a more friendly staff. All of the employees had smiles on their faces and were always very cordial and helpful. We did a lot of tourist things up in the LA and Burbank area and where able to make the drive in about 30 minutes depending on traffic. Our studio suite was fantastic! Our room felt just like an apartment! We had a king bed  living room  kitchen  desk/office area  bathroom  and large closet. The kitchen was stocked with everything except the food! We had a dishwasher  stove  and microwave. The room  just as all of the property  was very clean and our air conditioner kept our room very cool. The bathroom was rather large  my wife and I were both able to get ready at the same time without bumping into each other. The hotel offers a daily continental breakfast that is simple and good. They have 2 waffle irons  cereal  muffins  bagels  english muffins  and juices. The area does close at exactly 930 so you need to get there early. Seating is somewhat limited and the area fills up quickly. They have 2 people working to clean the area and assist guests. The one lady who seemed in charge of the area was very pleasant and friendly and was quick to come over to us every morning to welcome us back. The hotel seems to attract business travelers although there were some families there too. It was nice not to have too many kids around and to have an adult atmosphere. There are plenty of restaurants around that range from fast food and casual to fine dinning. Overall  this is a fabulous place to stay! Great location  great attractions  but most importantly a great staff!,Positive

Breakfast included with the room is always a plus for me. Room very nice. Desk staff helpful with my questions about a car rental and providing helpful advice.

The neighborhood is quiet with great food just a couple blocks away. The front desk staff was great with directions and the shuttle driver will take you anywhere within about a mile of the hotel. They are all very accommodating and helpful! While there is no pool or great views this hotel is incredibly comfortable  clean and easy to get to.

0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,We stayed here for 11 days just after spring break in the suites. As the hotel is newer (2 years old) it was in good condition and modern  one of the main reasons I chose it as some other properties are getting old and tired.It has a great location with easy access by car to Disney  Seaworld (across the road)  airport  International drive and outlets shops  very central to most areas. It has an access point onto the i4 on the doorstep and the 528 nearby.We chose the suites as we wanted room for such a long stay as on previous stays at Hampton Inn's we have found the standard room cramped. The room is very spacious and comfortable with beds  large desk  sofa and basic kitchenette (a sink  fridge microwave). It's worth the few extra dollars if you can afford it. The only down side to the rooms was a big lack of clothes storage areas (3 small drawers 7 hangers in wardrobe) and no plates/utensils in the kitchenette to eat from.We did have noise from the floor above and had to call reception one night to get them call the room above to quiet down at 11pm. The rooms were serviced each day but the level of cleaning was pretty poor - no change of sheets and tiled floor filthy and had to wear shoes in room or got black feet.The breakfast area is nice with quiet a good selection to each and drink. They also have a little food shop near reception which we found really handy for light meals and a bear when we didn't want to go out at night.The pool area was very clean with lots of sunbeds and chairs to use. It would be nice if they heated the pool as the water was uncomfortably cold unless you were doing laps.It is linked to Seaworld and some great perks so you should look into this if you are intending to go.There are also trolley stops nearby which can take you to outlets  international drive and universal (but not Disney) which is handy if you don't have a car.There was no safe in the room or safety deposit boxes at reception  as Orlando has a reputation for hotel break-ins I found this odd and an area they should seriously address.The staff for the most part were disinterested and very causal (no uniforms at reception)  for such a nice hotel this was a disappointment. Overall a good choice but not on the 'must' visit again list.,Positive

Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay  instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant  that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub  which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing  instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings  and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient  room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly. My apologies for the hot tub. Were looking into what might have been the problem! Before your next visit  please call the front desk directly to explore all room location options.

Great place  nice breakfast  and very large rooms. The staff are amazing and very ready and willing to help. It the kind of place that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. There is a kitchen in the room  but all the nice dinning restaurants are well within an easy walk.Hi Tony W  Thank you for the great review! We are flattered by your comments and glad that our location over the Pacific set the tone for an unforgettable stay. We look forward to creating many more wonderful memories for you in the future.

We were within walking distant to many stores  restaurants  Navy Pier  L stops and bus stops. The workout room was much smaller than the photo depicted but was well equipped for it's size. I would definitely recommend their valet parking. Very affordable with unlimited in and out privileges. Overall  I was very impressed and would definitely stay here again!,Positive

Very comfortable  good internet and not too dated.The lounge is a bit poor with very few places to sit down and do some work. There's a business center but like it didn't exist. Pathetic.

There is a shuttle service which we used from the hotel to the airport for a 7:30am departure. Shuttle arrived on-time and driver was super friendly and helpful even at that early hour. We did not use the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. Unfortunately  we did not realise until we had walked over the pedestrian walkway from the airport terminal to the shuttle stop that the courtesy 'phones were back in the terminal. So  after waiting a short while  we decided to just grab a cab - the cabs line up directly across from the shuttle bus stopping area. Check-in was friendly and efficient and even though we had arrived mid morning  the gal was only too pleased to provide us with a room that was ready along with a discount voucher for the restaurant next door and a free breakfast coupon.Reception has lots of seating available and there is a computer with printer available for free use either to do your airport check-in or surf the web.Room was lovely. Chest of drawers  tv  coffee maker  fridge and microwave  a couple of chairs and office desk and very comfortable bed. Loved the q-tips and cotton buds in the bathroom along with other standard items.Service by everyone was wonderful. Super friendly staff  room attendants and maintenance guys too. The free-Wifi connection was excellent both in the room  on it's balcony and down by the pool.The pool  though small was very clean  lots of towels were available and has chairs  umbrellas  loungers and tables as well as a soda and beer/wine dispenser.As mentioned  the location is perfect. It is easy to walk to the waterfront and there are plenty of shops  restaurants bars and cafes etc. in and around the hotel. The attached restaurant where the free breakfast (we didn't take the breakfast on this occasion) is served  provides excellent service a menu with lots of choices and the food was excellent and in very large portions!The wakeup call we had scheduled and the shuttle we arranged for an early morning departure were on-time and checkout was fast and friendly.Definitely would stay here again for a pre/post cruise or airport stopover and it would be okay for a longer stay too.,Positive

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,We enjoyed our stay here at the start of August. The room was spacious and had nice modern touches like lots of USB charging points  fast wifi  docking stations and the likes. The fridge was also useful. I'd definitely stay here again.The only downside was that our room was directly opposite the elevator. It pings twice every time the doors open which is extremely irritating when trying to sleep. (Of course  there is no option to take the stairs  it's lift or nothing  so it's in use all the time.) The hotel were happy to move us to another room which was near a lift that was out of order. Sadly it started working on one of the mornings so we still got disturbed. It wouldn't out me off staying here though.It's close to Fisherman's Wharf which may or may not suit. Accessible from SFO by BART and then on to F-line. We took an Uber back to SFO though and it only cost 10 more for two of us. Much easier.,Positive

The Shuttle service made up for that. Bed extremely comfortable  Nice lobby  friendly desk people....but....The noisiest plumbing I have ever experienced  anywhere! I do have acute hearing  but to wake up at 1:30 a.m. with the next room neighbor showering! Clunks  thunks  flushing---it might not bother everyone but it startled me  in an otherwise nice place. Trouble with their computer trying to print a boarding pass  but the desk person was glad to help told me they were working on that.Thank you for taking the time to submit your review and especially for mentioning your positive experiences as well as improvement areas. It is through feedback that we are able to maintain and improve upon our service and product. I sincerely apologize for the plumbing noise and would greatly appreciate if you could contact us with your room number to give us a chance to investigate  since this is not a common occurrence.

0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The hotel was just what we were looking for close to subway stations  shops  restaurants and a few blocks from Times Square. Set close to the fashion district  it may not be based in the busiest of streets  but after long day  sight-seeing or visiting friends. It was a place  my friend and I  were proud to call home for 5 days. When we arrived in New York  it was good to see Jamie smiling and helping us out in reception.The staff were very freindly and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was a good kick start in the morning  and complimentary web access was avaialble near reception  to look up places for the day ahead.Before booking the hotel I had read reviews  that rooms at this hotel are small  that maybe so. However  although they are quite small  they give you everything you need for a comfortable stay. Good beds  a tv  desk area and a compact bathroom with shower and bath.We definately look forward to returning here in the future. Its clean  comfortable and friendly. What more do you need.,Positive

Still did not work  they said they will send maintenance. 45 minutes later still hadn't arrived. Called desk. They said change channel. said we went throough that drill and were waiting for maintenance. Person said she would call as there was no record of the prior call. They came about 15 minutes after and had to replcae cables on tv. Extremely poor food and bar service. Ordered dinner at 10 pm (they serve until 2 am). Food finally arrived at our table around 11:40 pm. No comment from staff or anyone as to poor service. Wait staff contact with table to refill drinks  etc. during wait was once. Had to go to bar and try to flag down bartender if needed anything. Thank you for submitting a review about your recent experience. On behalf of the executive team allow me to first apologize for the service levels you experienced which failed to meet your expectations and our minimum standards. Wyndham sets the bar high when it comes to service standards  understanding the importance of taking extra steps to ensure our valued guests have a wonderful stay. I can assure you  your experience is not typical of the Wyndham Garden Dallas North and hope you give us another chance the next time you are in the North Dallas area.,Negative

The newest addition to the Westin Resort Family had little to do to ensure our pleasure. The decor was very inviting but we took a facility Hawiian culture tour and it came alive. The details from the lobby floors  walls and ceilings to the ground plantings have been so thoughtfully completed they noticed for themselves. We stayed in a suite just opened and have no complaint. I so have a suggestion though. It would be good to have an adult only area of the pool and hot tub. Aloha georgesA1682AQ Mahalo for your review. I am so sorry that the weather was not warm  bright  and sunny like usual but it seems that you made the most of it! We are pleased that you enjoyed all the different cultural elements that are displayed throughout our property.

The one that I stayed in was clean  modern and fine for one night or one week. I did not participate in the Free Breakfast as I woke up to late  There is free parking and if you miss breakfast there are plenty of places for breakfast or lunch nearby  This hotel is around 6 minutes or less from the main highway. I would stay here again.Thank you for being our guest at Extended Stay America. Its nice to know you enjoyed your time with us and were satisfied with all that we have to offer.

Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback  and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately  Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay. We worked very quickly to resolve the issue  though  and our system was back up in less than 24 hours. We truly value your business and hope that you'll give us another try in the future.

Fast Food eateries and Restaurants are within walking distance. It is about 10 minute drive to Disneyland. We didn't have a car  but utilized the Anaheim Resort Transit. We purchased a 3-day pass for 8.00 per person. It makes hourly stops to the Disney Transit Center.The front desk service for Check-In and Check-Out was friendly and helpful. The rooms were roomy and comfortable with a full kitchen. During our stay  we paid 113 per night for the AAA rate. As for the train tracks  yes it is adjacent to the property  but only runs during daylight hours. So  when your in room resting at night  the train noise is not a factor.I would definitely recommend this property to anyone  for its excellent location  away from the mickey tourist trap area.

Ruby Tuesday located right next door (but that is about it....no other places to eat that are close by). They are just completing a renovation of the property. New carpet  new wallpaper  new paint. Rooms are very clean and updated. Very comfortable bed. We had 2 queens - large room and bathroom. Free breakfast was convenient and kept well stocked. Refreshing ice tea in the afternoon and free slushies for my kids too! Pool looked clean although we did not use it. A real plus to have free parking as parking is outrageously expensive and an overall real nightmare in the downtown area. Only complaint was the new shower curtain was too long in the shower and we kept stepping on it during shower - it needs to be raised. Would definitely stay here again.Hello Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. The slushies are hit with the kids! We are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay.

When asked what the problem was  the staff said someone turned up the thermostat in the hallway to 90-degrees (serious!! this set off the fire alarm). Workout room had a TV that wasnt working  no towels available - in fact the container that was suppose to hold clean towels and deposit used towels was being used as a trash can! There were also nothing to wipe down the exercise equipment when you were done (gross). We are disheartened to read your review. Please accept our sincere apology for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay  and we did not live up to your expectations. We will personally address these issues with the appropriate teams to ensure happy guests is our number one priority.

I am genuinely sorry to read about your disappointment with our guests rooms  specifically regarding the size  smell  and the welcome amenities provided as it seemed that our accommodations were not comfortable for your needs and no value added was provided to you during your stay also I am truly sadden to hear that our gift bag and selections were not well received  our sincere apologies  as we provide about 60 gift bags per day and we update our amenities every month with different themes and varietals  we wish you had informed us of your disappointment with the choice of sangria  so we could have addressed on site  as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience.We are a currently following up with our housekeeping department on the strange smell  so we can ensure this situation will not surface in the near future. While the building structure is a historical building from 1907  and still maintains many of the architecturally historic qualities from the early 20th century including the interior corridors and original room layout  we are very proud of the overall quality  furniture and modern condition of our property. However this is not an excuse to justify your experience during your stay  we tried to provide you with all the amenities our property has to offer  but as we can see we fail on the delivery. I would like the opportunity to further discuss the details and concerns. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800.

We had 2 queens and a roll away and the room was not crowded. This has huge rooms and we never felt tight. Anytime we called to ask questions of the front desk  out concern was taken care of within minutes and questions answered immediately. The trolley in front was out of service  but the trolley on Canal street and buses are minutes away. You can get every where on these modes of transportation or on foot. Everyone in this city is so friendly and willing to aid tourists. If I ever visited New Orleans again  I would not stay anywhere else.This hotel does not have a pool or spa. It also does not have a restaurant  however there are 100s aroundThank you so much for staying with us during your AARP convention I am so pleased you guys enjoyed your stay!

I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko  Kimpton  etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean  very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF  so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great  1 block from the BART station  great if you are arriving from SFO  or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day  except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.,Positive

This Ritz Carlton however  provides luxury and immerses you with the local culture. Like what many neighbors of the Ritz Carlton experience  I felt like I was returning to a luxury residence building. You enter effortlessly past bellman that remember you  and into what feels more like a private foyer rather than a lobby. From there you can be up to your room in no-time given elevators that you rarely have to wait on and our rooms proximity to the elevator - which is what I loved given my 35pound dog traveled with me.The Parkview Guestroom we had on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and had unforgettable views into the park. Since it was winter  we were able to look right into the park - specifically viewing a sanctuary and large pond. The room was also very well laid out  and even with a rollaway bed it felt spacious.A spa treatment at the onsite LaPrairie Spa was very private and relaxing. Auden Bistro the Star Lounge feature classic menus with discrete service. Espressos ordered through Room Service arrived quickly and hot. And the complimentary coffee and tea in the bar was appreciated.The Ritz Carlton certainly extends their service and amenities to pets as well. My dog was treated like a prince! He was given several welcome amenities and genuinely recognized by the staff each time he passed through the lobby.The purpose of this stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday with my parents. They recognized the celebration and provided a unique amenity for my mom - a large silver frame with the Ritz Carlton logo! I even really enjoyed the location  with a great espresso bar around the corner  a very casual Italian restaurant recommended by the concierge  and of course the park.Some staff outshines others  there is a faint sound of street noise from the 6th floor  and there's the smell of horses when in front of the property - but none of this takes away from the hotel's well deserving status of being a Forbes 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond property. I will return.,Positive

The room size was fine  the bathroom was very nice. The room had a coffee machine but you can also get a free cup of coffee every morning ( great decaf) . We did not eat in the restaurant but instead ate at Lori's Diner ( turn left out of the hotel and it's a few blocks up on the right. Really good breakfasts) . The wine hour was a really good idea  we met some lovely people through this. The whole hotel is very clean  the staff are helpful and it felt like a little oasis of calm in the city. It is well placed for Union square and the trams. Just a note on the trams  we stayed 4 nights and never got on them  the queues were really long. We got taxis to fisherman's wharf for about 15 dollars. Some people have commented on the noise  yes the dustbin men do turn up about 3pm  and you hear the police sirens etc  but if you stay in a city you have to expect noise. They do have some rooms that have internal windows which are quieter . I think these are only doubles   as there were three of us we had a room facing a side road. You could still hear everything outside though. There was not any noise from other rooms or from people walking in the corridors. The beds were very comfy  with lovely pillows. We would defiantly stay here again. Thank you Galleria Park for making our stay a happy one .,Positive

It is a very nice hotel with all the ammenities you would need but not all you might find in a five star hotel. But   considering the location to the airport  Amtrak Location  and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And  about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel  you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member  you can't get a better deal  period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night  50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty!

Well  downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy  so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken  so there was only one  slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it  so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However  this should be a temporary issue  since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable  given the bandwidth frequired)  but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve  since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel  however it opens at 11am  so you can only get a brunch. Anyway  no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount  so I think the price was fair  otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.,Positive

Approximately 11:00  we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm  we found the room had not been touched.

However  l can honestly say that it was our best holiday ever! Okay the hotel and rooms could do with a refurb but it was clean and comfortable. For the money you pay  you cannot expect 5* service so if you just want somewhere comfortable to collapse at night after a day in the parks/shopping  this hotel is great. The hotel's location is excellent. You can walk to Universal in about 15 mins (or call the free fun spot bus to pick you up - reception will do this for you for free)  Wet and Wild is opposite the hotel  loads of restaurants are in walking distance (or you can jump on the i-trolley). All the parks are easily accessible from this hotel. If you want to use the wifi  you can only do this in the lobby or by the pool (some of the rooms near the lobby can pick it up if by the window). The breakfast is basic but fine  you can have frosted flakes  corn flakes  toast (toasters do take forever though)  tea  coffee and orange juice. If you want something else you can pay for pancakes etc or just pop across the road to Sizzler for an all you can eat buffet (3.99 pp). There are lots of good places to eat on international drive  we really enjoyed Chilli's and Uno. There is also a great takeaway pizza place across the road from the hotel. Being a vegetarian in Florida was a bit awkward as they really love their meat (our waitress in Chilli's had never served a vegetarian before) but most places have basic foods like veggie burgers/pizza/wraps etc.The pool at the hotel is quite small but l never saw it overcrowded and its open until 11pm. The pool bar has a happy hour from 6-8pm and you can order burgers etc too. The staff at the hotel are lovely and friendly. Whoever you spoke too  they were always very helpful. If we go back to Florida  we will stay in this hotel again.,Positive

She laid the keys on the counter while working and I noticed it said 222. I asked if that was second floor and she said yes. I told her I had requested a first floor when making the reservation two weeks earlier and she stated they didn't have any rooms on ground floor available very matter of fact. She continues with check in  never mentioned breakfast like they always have in the past. We unload and walk the small hike to the room. At 3:10 a.m. my husband jumps and startles me awake to find a rather large roach crawling on his face.He slaps the roach to the floor and chases it and gets rid of it. He calls the front desk to let them know what has happened and the man that answers the phone stated he would have maintenance take care of it the following morning. We then stay awake the rest of the night until time to leave for the hospital. He couldn't sleep thinking another roach was around there. I checked out the next morning and asked for the number to the corporate office and they never asked what was wrong  just told me they were owned by choice hotels. We have stayed at this hotel many times when it was Holiday Inn Express through my husbands illness we were in Atlanta a good bit off and on and never had a complaint but this was a very miserable night and we don't plan to stay at this hotel again.

I've stayed around the world in many small  dingy rooms  but I have never had a room that I couldn't stay in. After all  if you're in Orlando for a hotel room  maybe you should just stay home--you hardly spend any time in the room anyway. But for 28 a night  this was an incredible bargain. The room was very clean. The door keys take a special touch  but once you figure it out  it worked every time. The desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The cleaning staff did a great job every day...and worked around all of my girls' stuffed animals. We stayed here 6 nights with my family of 4 and couldn't have asked for a better place at this rate. The location is great--lots of restaurants  close to I-4  close to Sea World. The pool is beautiful (the weather was just a little too cold for us to enjoy the pool). Maybe it's not the most exotic place and could use a few touch-ups...but for this price in Orlando it's wonderful. If you're expecting a fancy room  this is not the place for you  but if you like a great deal  I would highly recommend it.,Positive

We had Valet Parking on arrival and a welcome glass of wine in the library bar (and there was a complementary glass at 5pm each eve). Great place to hang out and swap stories.The location was great for all we wanted to do. Do get a comfortable pair of sketchers (there is a shop near by buy one get second half price) as you will be walking up and down hills a lot! The air conditioning in our room 709 was a bit noisy so I was glad we did not need it much. You get a faint hum of the San Francisco sound at night which I loved and was not disturbing . We didn't dine in at all so can't comment on the food . So many eateries in San Fran. to choose from and loris for breakfast just down the hill a few yards on the same side has great choice and sensible price. We spent three nights here over a week end with another couple in the next room and we were able to shut the outer door and kept our own door open on occasions so great if you are with family or with close friends!Would certainly recommend staying here.,Positive

Gated underground parking (10/day)  friendly front desk staff  1 minute walk from your room to the beach. Right on the boardwalk  so whether you're looking for ice cream and a hotdog or a sit-down dinner after a day at the beach  it's all within walking distance. Forgot sunscreen  sunglasses  etc There are shops right on the board walk for that. Forgot toiletries  etc There's a CVS right behind the hotel. While the decor wasn't fancy  the hotel was always clean. The bathrooms were updated: walk-in  glass-doored  tiled showers and very large vanities  plenty of room for a family to spread out. Beds were so-so soft but not the most comfortable. If you're willing to pay premium  stay in the ocean-front rooms. We loved sitting on the balcony at night  people-watching and listening to the waves. You can hear the waves from the rooms with the sliding glass doors or windows open  but it's actually very quiet with them closed. We did stay on the north-end of the hotel  so I can't speak for the south-end where there are some restaurants/bars right next door that get loud at night/on weekends.You can also walk pretty much anywhere in Pacific Beach from here shopping  restaurants  etc. I recommend The Mission (in Mission Beach) and Leilani's Cafe for breakfast. Each is about a 15-20 mins walk from the hotel.Overall  happy with our stay  and we would stay again!Thank you for taking the time to provide our prospective guests with some great tips. We are glad to hear you had an enjoyable stay with us at the OPI. Thank you for highlighting our location  as we strongly believe that our location cannot be beat!

The hotel came exactly as advertised  we are familiar with the Hampton Brand  and I can thoroughly recommend this hotel as an excellent place to stay.Location is excellent  SeaWorld is an easy walk  Aquatica was a bit further but still only 25 mins for us as a family..and saved on shuttle times.Perks are as you would expect...quick queue being the best of all of them.Rooms were more than adequate...although my only surprise was there being no in room safe in ours (thought that would be a given in a tourist location).The best reason to stay at this hotel though was the staff. I cannot compliment them enough on their friendliness and readiness to help...from check in to check out  from suggesting places to eat and being kind to my son. We as a family appreciate when people are kind and polite to us  especially when the staff are dealing with 100s of people a day. First class...and enough of a reason for us to stay at this hotel again.Recommended by us for location and friendliness..and for what you would expect from a GOOD Hampton,Positive

The whole ocean views are right on the strand which might be a little too close. They offer toys and chairs to take to the beach. Also underground locked parking. In ocean beach it is almost impossible to locate on street parking. The staff are wonderful. The hot tub and pool are just the right temperatures. We also loved the balcony. You can really hear the ocean from there as well as just sitting on your very private balcony. You really don't need to rent a car. Everything is within walking distance. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and what the hotel have to offer to the TripAdvisor community. As I'm sure many will find this information very helpful. We are delighted to hear that you will be staying with us again  hopefully sometime soon!,Positive

The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness  the sheets were also high quality  and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus  as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby.Although their valet parking was expensive  there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am).My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average  a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped  especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still  I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money  and I would definitely stay there again.,Positive

The bed was so comfortable we hated to get up in the morning. The pool area was spotless. We ate one meal  breakfast  at the hotel restaurant. It was delicious but very expensive. My order was wrong and the staff promptly corrected it and did not charge us. There is a Starbucks right in the hotel which is very convenient and an entrance connecting to the Lenox Mall. The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions when we needed it. The Buckhead area is beautiful and full of wonderful restaurants. Our favorite was Eclipse Di Luna  an excellent tapas bar/restaurant. I would definitely stay at the JW Marriott again.,Positive

Main road behind hotel which thought was going to be a issue coz fairly loud but after spending days in the parks  i can honestly say i had 14 very good night sleeps. would stay there again but as i say it is a budget hotel  just a bed to rest your bed if you are after more form your hotel don't go here.,Positive

The reception staff were polite  if a little unapproachable  we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street  did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel  or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean  the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away  our room was facing the corner of a busy junction  on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night  every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated  true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far  but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel  and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS  right again and a cinema diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!,Positive

We stayed in room no. 9 which was a junior suite. Great  vintage couch. Goldfish named Bruce Lee on the wall. Patio. Air conditioning. The location is away from downtown in an area called Point Loma that has good restaurants (walking)and the Cabrillo National Monument Area nearby (driving). There are even some bayside beaches. I swam at one and it seemed pretty clean. And the pool at the Pearl is small but great. Drinks and music poolside! We pretty much had it to ourselves twice. It also has its own restaurant but we didn't eat there. Near the airport  too  but we drove in.Downside: my wife disliked the hard bed intensely. The traffic noise from the street is loud. Parking is limited and ten bucks extra. No guarantee you'll get a spot. Far from downtown and no trolley nearby. Pillows were absurdly uncomfortable! Go figure. That sounds like an oxymoron: uncomfortable pillows. My wife complained that there was no full-length mirror. Oh  well. More upside than downside in my book. I thought it was so different from the average hotel and I really enjoyed that. Cool place.Appreciate your review and comments. Hope you will come stay with us again in the future.

The overall property is very good and the staff is outstanding. Unfortunately our initial experience was very rough but the property management took accountability  immediately fixed the issues and followed up repeatedly to ensure our satisfaction. My family checked into the three bedroom villa on December 26th for seven days at Disney World. The overall layout of the room is excelled and we enjoyed the screened in porch overlooking the golf course and pond (ducks included). Upon arriving  the villa floors were filthy  carpets stained and bar stools worn to threadbare state. We've stayed at many Marriott Vacation Club properties over the years and experienced beautiful  clean and new(er) villas. The cleanliness of our villa was out of the ordinary. I called the GM  Eugene  and he immediately brought his staff to our villa to assess the situation and offer apologies. He committed to having all fixed by the time we returned from Magic Kingdom later that day. Eugene and team came through with grace and excellence. The room was deep cleaned  carpets shampooed and furniture replaced with brand new pieces. The Vacation Club staff treated me and my family like Diamond status owners the rest of the week. Eugene and his team turned a situation into an experience we will never forget. Well done!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced upon arrival but it is great to hear Eugene and staff were able to resolve the issue swiftly and to your satisfaction.

If you need to visit the wharf  hop on public transit a few blocks down. Gallerias room is small but very quaint and have been updated so one doesn't feel claustrophobic ! We had the queen bed and it was just right for a night - travel light - not a lot of floor space but they do have a small closet for your luggages. Rooms are small but it didn't bother us- bed linens were comfortable that's what matters. The property also has a third floor which opens up to a garden and small running track if you need to stretch your legs ! The reservation agent provided us with a pretty good deal so I couldn't turn it down - nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city. Wifi- free the first night ONLYParking- 49 a night with in and out privilegesFree wine reception in the evenings from 4-6pm in the lobby.Will come back since they gave us 15 off for the next booking.Dear MillieWT Thank you so much for the five-star review!!We are all pleased that your recent stay at Galleria Park went well enough that you plan to return in the future! The location is a wonderful draw to those looking for a city getaway for the weekend as you are able to access all of San Francisco without a car thanks to public transit. The Garden Terrace is a huge hit with our guests because it is very unique to have a green space in the center of a city (especially on the 3rd floor of a hotel!)

I felt it should have had higher end luxuries for example: large  fluffy towels. The room was set for 2 but only had 1 bathrobe. We ate breakfast at the buffet set in the lobby. The service was marginal at best. I asked for a coffee warmup twice and had to get out of my seat to find the waiter and remind him. Certainly unacceptable service for a JW.,Positive

Efficient check-in by staff but had to wait for room as it was not ready. This was no problem for us at all. We had just missed breakfast but tea and coffee was on tap all day at no extra cost which was a nice touch. When our room was ready (we were in the main block) we were pleasantly surprised how roomy it was with king sized bed  fridge  iron and ironing board and good bathroom with bath tub. It overlooked the lovely courtyard and pool area. The hotel didn't do lunch or dinner but staff were very helpful in suggesting a deli for lunch  where you could bring your sandwich back and eat in the breakfast area  and were helpful in suggesting where to eat for dinner. Bourbon Street was only a few blocks away which was very convenient. All in all  very attentive staff  good accommodation  excellent location  lovely courtyard with pool (although it was too cold to use it when we were there). Free wfi with small buriness centre. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.Thank you for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay in New Orleans.

0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,I called the hotel from the Atlanta airport where I was stranded. They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional  but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never  ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck  I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy  but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2  We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process  and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call. We completely understand your frustrations  so we would like to rectify your experience by refunding your cancellation should you decide to personally contact us with your confirmation number. Please email our General Manager  Terry Hitt  at tery.hittaloftatlantadtn.com  to further amend your situation. Again  we are very sorry for your experience  but we hope you will consider staying with our hotel when you have more time to visit the Atlanta area. All the best.,Negative

The beds were so comfortable that my mother wrote down the make and model number. I agree that the water pressure could use some improvement. The hotel is only a few blocks off of Canal Street which made it easy to walk to most of the places we wanted to go. From check-in to check-out we received excellent service. Christina and Cheryl took care of everything we needed  from suggesting restaurants  printing out directions  and ordering a cabs.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,First  the place is located in a great place. And the woman who greeted me was very very helpful and nice. However  if you're on a business trip and need the ammenities that come with a well-stocked hotel  this place is not for you. I had a single room on the top floor (4th floor)  I had no air-conditioning  no fan  and the window didn't create air flow in the room (when the temperature was 80 degrees outside  the room was much warmer). I'm not quite sure what the other reviews mean when they say all the rooms are huge because I had a really small room  with a twin bed that barely fit me. The WIFI was worse than the modem I used in 1997 and I barely could get anything done on my computer (I couldn't even check in for my flight on my computer). There is no television in your room. I had to share a bathroom with other people (which is fine)  but it's nice to have your own  especially when you're running around to get out the door fast. One morning  I had to leave around 6 AM  and I think I actually stood naked in the shower for about 5 minutes for the water to get hot. I guess this place would be great if you just needed a base camp for your time in Boston. I was there for job interviews (and I thought I could save some money)  but I actually regret it since one night  the room was so hot  I think I only had 2-3 hours of sleep.,Negative
1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,This is a very delayed review as it was 6 months ago this week that we stayed at the Pearl Hotel. Ive never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before  but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great  we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner  its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We werent going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!)  we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isnt a chain restaurant is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example  they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next days weather will be the menu for that evenings dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel  to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was  both my husband I had the burger loved it they arent lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace although it was a chilly November night  it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings  we had a few drinks in the bar the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar.With regards to the room  each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something Id never seen before in a hotel I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms all were of good standard.The location is pretty good  we drove to SeaWorld  San Diego Zoo Old Town none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego  the hotel rang up for a taxi it didnt take long to reach our destination. Overall  I would rate this hotel very highly if you are thinking about booking this hotel I recommend that you do as you wont regret it. 6 months on  all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel we still talk about our stay there it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas  San Diego  Anaheim LA. If we ever go back to San Diego  I will make sure we stay at this hotel if anyone who works at the hotel is reading this thank you very much for the fabulous service!Thank you very much for the detailed review.

The room standard is very high quality and comfortable  providing much needed respite from traveling. I am a frequent traveler and prefer the Hyatt over most other brands.,Positive

There was no room for me  so the front desk made arrangements for me to stay at the Courtyard  a 5 minute cab-ride away. When I arrived  I was immediately given a room  a nice  updated and rather spacious room. There was a King-size bed  a desk  large-screen flat TV  and a bathroom with the necessary amenities. The room had a roomy closet  luggage rack and most importantly  a heater/AC that actually worked very well. I spent a restful night. Unfortunately  there was no restaurant service in the evening  and no place open in the vicinity. Breakfast was simple next morning: coffee  scone and yogurt. The price was right and I got a cab in front of the hotel to get to my meeting with plenty of time to spare. This is a good place and I wouldn't mind returning at all.,Positive
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,We stayed for seven days  as the basis for a holiday in San Francisco  with several trips around the Bay Area. For our purposes  it was the perfect hotel.It was booked via our travel agent  and when I afterwards saw previous Tripadvisor reviews  I was quite concerned. However  I'm really glad we weren't put off by them.It's clearly quite an old hotel  and we were staying in one of the motel-style rooms in the main part of the hotel. As Brits on holiday for the first time in America  it felt like lovely quaint Americana. The fittings and furniture were clearly new a good few decades ago  but everything was functional and clean. The staff were helpful and polite. The location is great for public transport - just a few minutes' walk to Market Street  and then you're right next to MUNI stops  and the Civic Center BART station  so travel around the city and beyond is very convenient.It's a very limited breakfast (but that's advertised)  and a great bonus is that it's right next door to Sightglass - a lovely coffee roastery and coffee bar  if you want a good coffee to start the day. You're also right around the corner from two excellent craft beer bars - City Beer Store  and Cellarmaker.Being in the South of Market area (SOMA)  you do feel you need your wits about you if out after dark  but it's the same in any city really.Overall  if you want a stylish hotel with modern fittings  this isn't it. But we wanted a budget hotel in the centre of the city for a holiday  and it was perfect for us.,Positive

0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,We stayed at this hotel last night while my grandfather was hospitalized because it was attatched to the Virginia Mason Hospital. The floors were so dirty that u could see the dirt sitting on top of the carpet  the mirrors were covered in dirty streaks  and the tub was full of leftover residue from recently removed no-skid strips! I have never been in a dirtier hotel room and am absolutely appalled that it is attatched to such an amazing hospital. The front counter staff was very kind and helpful but the state of the room was unbelievable. The toilet seat nearly slid off when I sat down and the wall plugs look like they're from the 1940s as we couldn't keep a single charger from falling out of the wall. It was an absolute waste of money I have spent nights in rooms that were half the price and twice as nice. Don't waste your money here - spend the night at one of the nicer hotels that are only 5 minutes down the road for less money and a better experience.Good morning. Thank you for your comments. As you can tell from previous trip advisor reviews  your stay is not the typical experience our guests enjoy. I have shared your comments with our housekeeping team - while the rooms are older  our staff works very hard to ensure rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It was a very busy weekend in Seattle and we are proud we are able to offer an affordable alternative for guests and family members seeking medical care. We hope your grandfather is feeling better. Good luck in your future travels  Carol Gallagher,Negative

1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Booked the Hilton Garden Inn Miami Airport West at 3550 NW 74th Ave. because it had 14 days of free parking. We booked through the Stay123 website for a one night stay on April 22  2018. Deposit of 22.60 and a payment of 186.45 at check-in. Not only did we get the free parking  we also got a complimentary one way shuttle to the cruise ship. The cruise port is approximately 8 miles away. The taxi back from the cruise was about 50.00. It was much quicker than waiting for a hotel shuttle which would have been about the same amount.Quickly checked in by Hillary to room 414 in the back - away from traffic. It faced an industrial park. We were close to the Miami airport  but great insulation - as we did not hear any plane noises.No meals were included - a restaurant was available on the premises for food. I have posted photos of menu.Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. I am happy to hear you found the hotel and staff to your liking. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the future. Our goal is to make your stay better and brighter. If something isn't just the way you like it  simply let any Team Member know  and we will make it right.
