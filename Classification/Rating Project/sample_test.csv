No problems of any kind. The hotel was full  so the breakfast area was crowded  but the food was still good  and for the most part was replenished when an item had run out. Will definitely stay here again.

I'd read other reviews of the hotel  so I requested a room on a low floor in a quiet spot. The wonderful  friendly desk staff were very accommodating and put me on the second floor  which allowed me to take the stairway to the lobby. I was a little concerned about the bed  having read other reviews. No worries  the bed was very comfortable  not too hard at all. The room was updated and appointed well. While I'm sure there are some small rooms in the hotel - after all it is San Francisco - the one I had was a perfect size. The bathroom was tiny - after all it is San Francisco - but remodeled and clean. Across from the theater  two blocks down from Union Square and some of the best shopping in the world  any type of food you can imagine within a few blocks.Thank you very much for sharing this great feedback on your recent stay with us! We are pleased to hear you had a wonderful first impression and enjoyed the bubbly! We strive for great service and are happy you found our staff friendly and helpful. Your review means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,Hotel is good for a very short stay. I had a partial view of the beach which was good. I was 1/2 block from the beach. I was 1 block from the main st Mission ave and several blocks from the main drag where all the shops and restaurants are. Found a cute coffee shop as I needed a real meal with fruit which was not available at the hotel. This cute shop in a house is called Cafe 976 and has Gluten free items. It is on 976 Felspar st. Cross mission 1 block to Felspar and then turn right  then walk about 5 blocks. You can't miss it. I wish my room had a table. It had a huge lounge chair too big. There was also some water leakage from the shower which had damage the lower door area. I thought i saw traces of mold but I tried not to think about that. I made a note of it when I checked out. The bed was very comfortable. The TV worked ad the workers pleasant and helpful. They might add fruit to their breakfast bar  after all its Califormia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,This was my first visit to New Orleans and the first time I have ever stayed at a Drury Inn. The hospitality was great! Room was clean  the appliances and TV were in good working order. The beds were comfortable. I felt safe  Only guests were able to use the elevators with their key cards. The only complaint was the ice machine was near our room and it was making lots of noise. They were able to fix the problem the next day.The breakfast bar and appetizers were very good. Lots of variety and plenty to eat. If you are going with children or teenagers  it is very good on your food budget. The hotel was near the St Charles trolley line and Jackson Square. I was able to walk to the square early in the morning and just enjoy some people watching. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly.
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,We booked an overnight stay at Hampton Inn in December. We usually stay at the Renaissance when we stay near the airport  but that hotel was booked  so we found the Hampton. We don't regret it one bit! We would definitely stay here again.Check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly. Our room was ready immediately upon arrival at 3PM. We got a room on the 5th floor with a nice view of the city skyline. The room was clean and spacious. We booked at king- bed room with a pull-out sofa bed and all four of us (all adults) slept comfortably. The HVAC unit was very efficient. When we came in there was cold air blowing  but after a slight thermostat adjustment it was very cozy. There is free Wi-fi in the rooms. All you need to log in is your name and room   so that was very convenient. We didn't notice any noise from neighboring rooms  but several doors slamming in the hallway at 5AM did not go unnoticed. I guess one should expect that from an airport hotel  however  since most travelers will be leaving early to catch a flight. An airport shuttle runs fairly frequently  but we weren't flying on this trip so we didn't use it. However  we did need a cab and had the front desk staff call for one. It arrived in less than 5 minutes! For meals  there is a Ruby Tuesday next door. We chose to dine in the city that night. We did  however  enjoy the free breakfast in the morning. Hot food  not just continental fare! The coffee was freshly brewed and the food was plentiful. That morning they served cheese omlettes and turkey sausage but I understand that the menu changes daily.Overall  a good hotel and the price was quite reasonable! We will definitely stay here again.

Sharlene treated us like royalty! After learning of why we were staying she offered to upgrade our room with the understanding it wouldn't be ready for a couple more hours - no worries since we were going to celebrate with friends at a local restaurant. Upon our return several hours later Todd was there to assist as well and checked us in quickly with a big smile and great sense of humor. Sharlene appeared and provided gift bags with water a snack which was an additionally sweet gesture. The room was clean and adequate space for our stay and the continental breakfast was amazing! Many choices and all was very fresh accompanied by another great member of the staff to ensure we had everything we needed! They all made an emotional time much better with their friendly smiles  positive attitudes and great sense of humors. We would stay there again when in town to visit friends in that area and recommend to others for sure - great job!!!Dear Tricia M. Thank you for providing us with your feedback of our property. It's great to hear that your time with us was great and that our staff was able to help make your stay a better one. I will make sure that both Sharlene and Todd are aware of your review and that they are recognized at our next meeting. Also  I'm glad that our property ended up being perfect for your stay. We hope to see you again soon. Thanks!

It is between Disney and Universal areas. The hotel is located next to the I-4 highway  we had a room looking at the highway and it was good  no noise  you can see the Orlando Premium Outlet and some horses in a vast green area. The staff at the front desk totally helpful and polite. We had one bedroom suite and it was really comfortable  very clean. The free wifi connection excellent. The only thing I didn't like and I got bored was the breakfast. Everyday the same buffet breakfast: sausage and scrambled eggs. I think they should vary it. The dinner was good and delicious. The staff at the breakfast and dinner area very nice and they did a good job. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.Hi there zlbenites!Thank you very much for your positive feedback. I 'm so glad to hear that you and your husband enjoyed your stay. It's so refreshing to hear how were doing from you: our valued guest. I want you to know that my team and I take these reviews very seriously. I share every last one with them so they're all aware of how we're all doing. It's encouraging but it also gives us ideas for how to wow future/returning guests. I will definitely share this with the breakfast chef so he knows to add more variety. Thank you again and see you next time!

The common areas were extremely clean and the view from observation deck thingy was truly amazing. The staff was awesome in every possible way. We utilized one of the garages across the street and a word of warning they are small (had a full size rental and it just fit--don't plan on parking your full size SUV there and it is doubtful that a mid-size would fit). Breakfast was plentiful and the fruits  eggs... were very good  a disappointment though were the baked goods  although good they were not home made . Please understand they were very good  but when I stay in a BnB I don't expect store bought. Two other minor complaints  guests on their cell phones in the BF room and common areas  I was also working but i limited my cell phone usage to our rooms and outside lastly the dog. We are all dog lovers but not sure how appropriate it is to have the dog sitting on the chairs. Again overall a great experience and would most likely stay there again but need to call it as I see it.

My go to hotel is the Hilton Garden Inn MCO. The staff is very friendly  the service is always consistently good and the accommodations are clean and comfortable. Our most recent stays were during and then shortly after renovations and the new lobby looks modern and inviting. The restaurant offers a very good breakfast and my only disappointment from our last stay was having to leave before the restaurant opened in order to catch an early flight.Dear Guest Charlie W  I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.

The check in was a little slow due to the front desk agent dealing with a difficult guest. Our check in was quick because being a night auditor I know check in procedures and IHG reward standards. I was happy they gave my request for 2 beds as well as a decent view! The room was super clean. Only minor issue was that there was no garbage bags in the room. I used the laundry bag instead. Great job staff at HIE Times Square. :)Dear taylorma05 5-stars from someone who knows hospitality - wow thank you so much! I'm happy to hear that we were able to meet your request and that your room was very clean. I will share all of your comments with my team so we can continue to focus on cleanliness and service!
1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Ok spacious room. Bed ok not great. No amenities for SPG members let alone platinum members. I had to ask for my welcome gift. Restaurant awful. First warm drinks dusty bottles when having ordered a drink it certainly wasn't cold bottles. Then I was waiting for my breakfast ready to take a shuttle to the airport and the girl said no problem to have an omelet ordered and eaten by the time we had to leave for the shuttle. Well they kept coming back and saying it's almost ready and needless to say it wasn't. I wish she would have saved the trouble and told me to eat the buffet because I left without breakfast. Not an spg property. Won't waste my time staying here again. The Marriott across the way is much better. We always greatly appreciate the feedback of a frequent traveler such as yourself. It is correct that due to the size of our property we do not have an SPG Club Lounge  but offer all other SPG amenities in the Starwood program. You certainly should not have to ask for your welcome gift. We currently have several brand new team members at our front desk and although the SPG program is one of the first training items covered  your feedback allows us to identify need areas. I would also like to apologize for the delay in your breakfast order  which could only have been caused by unusual high volume at the time  which is however certainly not an excuse for not delivering the exceptional level of service that we are known for. We deeply regret the inconvenience we have caused you.

1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,My husband was taken seriously ill whilst we were on holiday in Florida (From the UK) and admitted to the Florida Hospital Orlando right next door to this hotel. I stayed for 13 nights and my husband was with me for 9 nights following his surgery. I had no car (My husband did all the driving) so was relieved that there is a free shuttle which runs between the hotel and the hospital and is available upon request. Wendy's was right next to the car park and there is a 7 Eleven petrol station on the corner so I was able to get everything I needed. Having the fridge in the room and micowave was also very useful. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff whether it was getting extra pillows or faxing my insurance documents to the UK. What I needed most was kindness and I certainly got that from everybody we had dealings with. The rooms are a good size and I had a sofa for my husband to sit on and a desk where I could work. The showers are really good and the bath was most useful for my husband. The large King beds are out of this world -the best beds ever! The breakfast is more than adequate and we appreciated coffee being available all the time. Whilst a number of people stay because of the close proximity of the hotel to the hospital this hotel is a happy safe place and we had lots of fun around the pool whilst my husband was recovering.Yes there are no doubt better hotels in Orlando but not at this price and I doubt whether the beds will be any more comfortable. If you want excellent value for money in a safe friendly environment then book this hotel.

It looks nice but as the day goes on I kill at least 8 stink bugs  the bugs that emit a disgusting smell when killed. I use the jacuzzi tub and one of the jets do not work some of the towles have this yellow residue on it and the tub wasnt completely clean. I check out today to find out they charged me 150 dollars because I left some tobacco in the trash which they institute as smoking. I make my own cigarettes so sometimes I do not use all of the tobacco but if I wouldve known I would be charged 150 dollars for leaving tobacco around I would have never went to this hotel. I did not smoke in the room at all and i know it smells nothing like smoke so I do not understand what constitutes the charge of 150 dollars. The general manager was not there so I have to wait until Monday.Our entire hotel is non-smoking. We do charge one hundred and fifty dollars when a guest smokes in the room. We did have several smoking area around the hotel so our guest can smoke outside.Willis Blake DOS

The more I explore NOLA the more I like the business area. It's quieter and has some new and old hotels that seem lovely  like the St. James. This appears to be a revitalized historical building. The lobby and courtyards are beautiful. I liked the croissants and coffee/tea/juice delivered to your room every morning. Loved the wood floors and large windows. Ariel at the Front Desk was beyond welcoming and friendly. She represents New Orleans well! My daughter adored her. All the staff was exceptional. If you need something  please ask. And be nice to them. They are human too. The Chop House attached to the hotel is amazing and staff is just as wonderful! Treat yourself to dinner there. I do feel that Housekeeping was a little lacking  but when I mentioned it  my concerns were resolved. It's a unique and lovely hotel.Dear Elizabeth S Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Thank you for the feedback regarding our service and amenities. Also  our building is restored from the Civil War period as we used to be a hospital for Union soldiers among other things so good eye!

It's location in the heart of the French Quarter puts you in walking distance of all the major attractions and if you don't plan on leaving the city  don't bother renting a car since you won't need it. If you're looking for a modern high rise hotel with loads of brand new bells and whistles  go somewhere else!! If you're someone who appreciates the true flavor of New Orleans  then this is the place for you!! The French Market Inn maintains the historic charm of the city with authentic furnishings  high ceilings  and an adorable central courtyard containing a small in-ground pool that doesn't compromise the historic feel of the property. The mattresses were comfortable  the linens were clean  and the large showers had amazing water pressure. The desk and bell staff were polite and very helpful  and I recommend this hotel to visitors of all ages.Hi Christopher  thank you for choosing our historic hotel and taking the time to share your experience.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,My friend and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Rex while attending a conference at the Moscone Center  and it is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. It's basically how I envision my fantasy home: literary references everywhere  warm and eclectic colour scheme  coffee every morning and wine (one glass free for guests!) every evening  and live jazz music once a week. I am in love with this place. The location is wonderful  too  just a few blocks from Union Square and 15 minutes walk to the conference centre. I do have to say thank goodness for conference rates  because as lovely as the Rex is  I still can't imagine paying 360/night for a hotel (but I'm a poor grad student  so take that as you will).

The staff was friendly and helpful (Aires and Taiana)  the building was older an undergoing renovations  but clean  quiet and comfortable. I loved the cloister atmosphere of the ground with the numerous sitting areas and am looking forward to staying there again.Breakfast was complete and had just about anything you might want  and the coffee was some of the BEST we have ever had! Driving in Atlanta traffic is not fun  but they are close toe two large shopping malls and many good restaurants  and have a shuttle that will take you there! The kitchen has everything you might need except for pots and pans  which you can get from the office. So if you are staying a long time this is ideal. The bed room has a door to cut it off from the living area  there are two TV's and the kitchen has a dishwasher and garbage disposal!Thank you for your wonderful comments! We're delighted that you enjoyed your stay at our property and we appreciate you recognizing our friendly staff  clean and spacious suites  breakfast and our shuttle. We hope to see you again soon!

We had a two bedroom two bathroom suite my wife and I shared with her two sisters. The rooms were seperated by a Kitchen and living room area. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was exceptional. We had never been to Seattle before and Mary  Susanne and Eric were always there to help us with our sightseeing questions and needs. The fist day we walked to the space needle and then took the monorail to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. We then took the streetcar back to the hotel. We had a reservation at another hotel post cruise  but cancelled it and went back to the Residence Inn. They have a great breakfast in the morning  free Wi-fi in the rooms  and it is right out the door from Lake Union  great restaurants and the marina. The hotel rates were reasonable and we just can't say enough about the city  hotel and the staff. We'll be back!

1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,First  perfect location for PETCO  Convention  and Gas Lamp!Spent 3 nights at Solamar for a convention. First upon arrival I was quickly greeted by the valet and taken care of. They offered bag service but I was okay handling my own. I checked-in quickly with Q and headed straight up to the room on the 7th floor. When I arrived at my room the door was open. It was rather strange but I made sure I knocked and called out because I didn't want to walk in on anything I didn't want to see :)The room was clean. I had a window with a view of another building. Nothing too much there. The TV was massive and to be honest was pleasant because I didn't sacrifice my NFL experience away from home. Here's where my experience got a little ruff. At 4:30 am I was woke up by a screaming child in the adjacent room. I get it  kids are kids  but this screaming was more of an attention getting scream because there was no crying  just screaming. So I tried to sleep and eventually the child stopped screaming. Then at 6:30 the kid was playing and screaming at the same time. That was it  no more sleep for the day. I got up to take a shower just to leave  and that was when I noticed the shower head was leaking from the top  mildew in the tile cracks  and heavy mildew at the drain. Blocked that out of my head and just showered up. I will say the water pressure is on point. When I returned to the room later that day I tried to just relax  and then the kid started screaming. I didn't want to judge the kid and become angry so I called the front desk. Q answered and I explained to him what was going on. He even mentioned on the phone that he could hear the kid through the phone. He quickly provided me two options  I chose one and I was set for the rest of the trip. I moved to the 8th floor  view of the pool and not a peep from anyone or anything. In summary  Q is the reason my review is 4 stars. He saved my trip and experience. I was able to sleep uninterrupted! I knocked the score one point for the cleanliness of the bathroom in 706. The 8th floor bathroom was noticeably cleaner (816). Thanks for a great experience Q and Solamar. Will consider this location as an option in the future!Thank you CAm2317 for this detailed and candid review. I couldn't be happier to see that Q saved the day on your seemingly frustrating visit. I'm very sorry for the experience you had. I have shared your feedback regarding the door having been left open and the shower issue with our Executive Housekeeper for follow up with our team. That feedback is very concerning  it has not been taken lightly and will be used as a training opportunity for our team to ensure that such an experience does not repeat itself. Please feel free to contact me prior to your next visit and I will ensure you have a fantastic visit. Thank you again for writing. All my best  Shannon shannon.fosterhotelsolamar.com

They charge your card before you ever arrive. Not just reserve the money but charge the card. 2. A 72 hour cancellation policy (ridiculous) and they never answer the phones so canceling is impossible anyway. 3. Would not honor Google offers coupon. 4. Blinds do not block the light so your up at 6 whether you like it or not. 5. Noisy street. The only reason this got 2 stars is the room is new and clean but I would never stay here again!

Our kids (ages 4 6) loved swimming in the pool just about daily. Although I enjoyed the hot tub  the drains maybe were plugged since a couple nights the water was spilling over with n a couple people in the hot tub. However I did not notify staff-so I am not complaining  it seemed resolved in subsequent nights.We did have an issue we reported to request a new tub drain plug/stopper and never did get one. We requested twice and the second time was two days before we left so when the kids took baths that night we just made do since we weren't going to wait for maintenance during the bedtime hours.All in ill we had and enjoyable trip and this was a tremendous centralized location for all the sites we wanted to see.

What a nice surprise  exceeding my expectations. The experence at Estancia was relaxed first class from the start. Champain with check in! I switched flights at the last minute and arrived before noon vs my 4 PM scheduled arrival. No problem. They had a deluxe king room overlooking the courtyard available. A little work for business and then meet several friends at Trinitas wine bar for tapas and drinks. Attentive service. One of the best services was Josh the shuttle driver! The hotel supplies a free shuttle to areas with in a 5 mile radius. Josh was great providing nice suggestions for places to visit in the Cove  La Jolla shores and a Saturday activity. Chris the concierge was super helpful with dinner reservations and booking activities. Great follow up on everything. While I didn't use the spa it looks fabulous and when my wife comes next time we will b e sure to try out the services.Dear boblafollette We're so pleased that you chose to stay at Estancia.

The hotel is in such a good location and is only a quick walk to Union Square  the Powell-Mason Cable Car  the BART and the huge Westfield shopping centre. There's also a lovely coffee shop called Bread Cocoa next door. Big drawcards: complimentary wi-fi and wine hour! Next time I go back to San Fran I will not even consider staying somewhere else.

I got the accessible bathroom and it was huge. The breakfast at the attached restaurant (312 Chicago) was hotel-pricey but very excellent. Short Rib Hash was greeeattt.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,This was a great hotel because of the feel of a small one bedroom apartment. We took full advantage of the kitchen and bought groceries for our three nights there. It is walking distance w/in great restaurants (right across the street!). And now that the Trolley is up and running  you can take that to the Seattle Center and Downtown. They have a stop right in front of the hotel! Very convenient  esp. when the free hotel shuttle bus stops running in the evening around 6pm. The staff were all pleasant from the time we came till the end of our stay. The bed was very comfortable w/a feathered pillow top. There is a controlled heating and cooling system in the room. The only prob. w/that is the noise. But it really didn't bother us. Parking does cost money but there is free parking in the back of the hotel. There is meter parking that's free after 6 and free all day Sundays. The free breakfast in the morning was excellent. They offered the usual breakfast foods (home made waffles  eggs  sausage  oatmeal  cereal  yogurt  fresh fruits  etc.etc.).It was a great stay and I would definitely come back!

Now I am glad that they did . Its smaller and more managable than the Annatole which is HUGE. Room was pretty standard but did have microwave  refrigerator and coffee pot standard. Bathroom was on the large size. Cleanliness was not the best  but certainly not the worst. No Bed Bugs. Hotel business center is free! Yeah HGI. Also there is high speed internet in all the rooms. And you can send printing to the business center from your room. Highlight for me was the van service  especially when Reynaldo was driving. Because I am short and have a prosthetic leg I needed a stool to get into the very high 15 passenger van. He found one and every time he picked me up or took me across to the Annatole he had to run around and find it again. THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE PERMANENTLY IN THE VAN. My room was not ready when I arrived at 3:30 PM. The desk clerk offered me a snack from the little store. Or to have the van take me to a restaurant. She recommended several restaurants we settled on one. When Reynaldo and I were talking enroute  and he learned it was my first trip to Texas  he asked if I liked BBQ. He then took me into downtown Dallas to Sonny Bryans. It was great! The highlight of my whole trip as I never had another chance for a real meal again. On the way back to HGI  Reynaldo when he picked me up drove past the Book Depository Museum and pointed out Dealy Plaza and the grassy knoll. I never would have seen either were it not for him. Other employees were adequate in the restaurant etc. Other van drivers not so good--no stool etc. Desk employees were pretty efficient and well informed. The restaurant in the hotel in only open for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is full (eggs  bacon and sausage  pancakes  omlets cooked to order) or continental. There is a pretty complete buffet with hot and cold cereal  muffins  bagels  toast  fresh fruit  yoghurt  etc. Its pricey at 12 but free to government employees. Dinner menu is limited and there is a nightly special. Not on the menu  but available is a soup and salad combo for dinner at 7.95. It was exactly what I wanted. Room service is available.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your comments and feedback as this allows us to improve our products and servcies for you and all future guests of ours. I appreciate your business and loyalty to Hilton Hotels and truly value your feedback. We have purchased 2 new stools for the van so that we are proactive and have them available at all times. Thank you for recognizing our van driver for his services provided and he will be rewarded for his exceptional service. If there is anything I can do for you in the future  please let me know at anytime. Thank you again and have a wonderful holiday.Best Regards Blake DoranGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center

Multiple older New Orleans buildings joined together to make an Inn full of character and charm. Interior courtyard was surprising  cool  and quiet...beautiful bricks  fountains  plants  trees  and a small but inviting pool. Perfect place to unwind after walking the streets of the French Quarter!Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn! We're pleased to hear you found our historic hotel a perfect place to unwind after exploring the French Quarter  and hope to welcome you back soon.

Located on a small man made island  you can go for a walk on a path which circles the entire island  incredible views. Staff were exceptional  service was excellent. Many restaurants located a short walk away. Highly recommended.

I had read some reviews that had issues with check in and we sure had some too  but the staff more than compensated for this and I would still give full marks for the property and its people. Im going to single out Evan at the front desk and Lisa who is one of the restaurants servers. amazing service. Its nice to feel welcome in any hotel or resort  but these two staffers in particular really did make a great impression with their attention to customer service and great attitudes. It's not just the property that brings people back  it the people for sure and we will gladly return!Dear jjbozzi  Thank you for taking the time to review your experience at Estancia La Jolla. It's always a pleasure to hear when our team leaves such an impression. We will certainly share your kind words with Evan  Lisa and the rest of the Estancia staff.

There were multiple waiters taking care of all our needs. The room was great and the customer service from the front desk was excellent. The location is very close to the airport. The only negative experience was the 15 minute wait for the shuttle.Dear JohnTSanAntone Thank you so much for the five-star review and for taking the time to tell us that we succeeded in providing you with a comfortable stay. I am so glad our accommodations  facilities and terrific location were all a big hit  and that the breakfast we offered you added more value to your stay.

0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,As with other reviews  in spite of the freeway noise the hotel is above par  on the older side but extremely well maintained. A small but clean pool... a fitness room would be a plus. The neon sign claims that the staff are friendly - that is true - it also states that the hotel provides a continental breakfast. For some hotels that would be a few muffins  cold cereal and packet of bagels.... not so here. Cheese omelettes  bacon and hash browns as well as biscuits and gravy  lots of fruit and greek yogurt  and of course the obligatory muffins and bagels. This  in my estimation is not a continental breakfast but a great well balanced meal with lots of options. Would we stay there again... in a heart beat!!! Thank you for being a part of our weekend getaway. Location very central for out Annie Russell theater trip  dinner in Winter Park  Global Energy 10K at Festival park and Cirque du Soleil at the Amway.Thank you for providing us with your review of our property. I'd like to start by thanking you on behave of our staff and I'm glad that we were able to help enhance your time with us. Instead of having a fitness room  we did just put into action a new Fitness-in-a-bag system. We do not have the fitness room  but we offer this instead  so that guest may still be able to exercise in the comfort of their rooms with some of the fitness gear provided in the bag. We hope that you do choose to stay with us again soon.

0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,So my boyfriend and his friend had just moved out and had to stay at a hotel for a week before moving into to their new place. This place is moderately cheap  but there is great reasoning for that. This place is absolutely disgusting  the pool was green and not taken care of  the elevator was sketchy  it's located right off the freeway  (so don't expect a quiet nights sleep)w and the rooms smelled like death. But that wasn't even the worst part  it was the Indian managers customer service and attitude. I live in Seattle  and out of the week my boyfriend was staying there I slept over two times. The second time  it was the last day of his stay  and I was downstairs getting us breakfast (which was STALE mini bagels  and little muffins which were not that great) and the Indian manager was watching me the whole time. When I was heading back up he approached me and asked my room number  I told him and he stated only two people were checked into that room. I said my boyfriend is one of them and I've only stayed two nights and he went off how I was lying and he was going to charge them an extra 30 dollars a NIGHT. I went back up to the room and my boyfriend was still sleeping and he called our room and started yelling at him over the phone  so he went downstairs to talk it out with him. Eventually after being harassed several times the Indian man gave up. Once it was check out at 10 am  he came to our door and stood there yelling at us until we were out. Worst service I've ever had in my entire life  DO NOT GO HERE. There's a Best Western not too far on Denny that's not much more expensive and has wonderful service  better location and a more comfortable room.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We truly value the opinions of our customers and we apologize that we did not meet your expectations. Providing our guests with the best possible hospitality and service has always been our mission. We apologize for the issues you experienced. We have addressed this issue with our team and management. We continually strive to keep our property clean  friendly  and welcoming.

Easy access to Route 29  and a bike path that leads into town. We were guests of our son  but he stays here often on business. He told us Chablis Inn offered the best quality for the money.

The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were nice  but a bit on the small side. The location was good  nothing in walking distance though. We didn't get a chance to have breakfast  so no review on that.

1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Checking in sort of a nightmare. Rooms were not ready at 2p check in time went out to do some shopping and room still not ready at 4p. (Note: the next 2 days our room wasn't clean until about that time.) Hotel is in safe neighborhood and  while very close to the freeway  once we shut the door  we hardly heard any road traffic and our room was probably closest to the road. Room was not antiseptic  but certainly clean enough. Bathroom tiny but the room itself was fine with a fridge and microwave. Had some issues with keys not working and the pool is bathtub size so don't get your hopes up. Breakfast was about what one would expect and the breakfast area is small but it was never crowded. If you want a clean quiet room at a bargain price  this place fits the bill but don't expect too much. Thank you Bruce for your feedback. Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you encountered during your stay and for we failed to meet your expectations. I have forwarded your feedback to the front desk staff and management team. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and hope to see you again soon.

1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,Trip was Oct 16-18. Hotel is not suitable for normal tourists. It is adjacent to and connected to a hospital. It may be suitable for patients or their families  but it is not something a tourist would want. The hotel is very old. There is a skeleton staff. The web site shows a nice food service area or restaurant. During our stay  there was no restaurant at all. These photos should be taken down. They are misleading at the least. There is no parking with this hotel. The desk will refer you to a public lot around the corner. The public parking has issues: (a) it has limited spaces for public use and you may be out of luck on a busy time (we did find one available) (b) it is not cheap (c) the main complaint here is that there is no in and out in this public lot. So  this is not like a valet parking where you pay one day and can go in and out. You park and are stuck or risk additional fees etc. The rooms are very small. The bathroom is tiny (one person only). The furniture in the room is old and not comfortable. Two chairs and a small table. You must be in the bed to view the TV comfortably. Food: as noted  there is no restaurant in the hotel. The food - - aka room service actually comes from the hospital kitchen. There is an elevator connection to the hospital  and you can eat in the hospital cafeteria. Otherwise  there is no food in the hotel. The staff was one person at the desk. No bell man etc. There may be ways to get a wheel chair into the hotel  but I did not see them. I saw several elderly ladies in walkers have a very difficult time getting up the 6 to 9 stairs at the entrance. The owners have put no money to update this hotel. If you call one of the room service numbers  the first prompt is for you to provide your glucose tolerance numbers. Quite a shock for a tourist with a first time in Seattle. On one occasion  I called the front desk. Let it ring 15 to 20 times. No answer. When I went down  I asked: why was no one answering the phone at the desk The answer: I was out for a moment across the street. It is also worth noting that there is only one elevator in the hotel for guests. Not a problem as long as few people are in the hotel. It was very slow a few times when the Seahawks game came closer. This is not an upscale neighborhood. There is a nice breakfast place about a 5 minute walk away. Starbucks an easy 10 minute walk (Well run Starbucks). From what we saw walking down to the ferry would not wise. There are good number of homeless folks down closer to the Seahawks and Mariners stadium (a Salvation army facility is quite near the stadiums). I did not feel it was unsafe for myself  but would not want my wife and I to walk that way. In summary  THIS HOTEL IS AN HOSPITAL ADJUNCT. It is not a place where a tourist would want to stay unless were the dominant concern and staying downtown was required. It is simply a very old hotel with limited staff  no food (unless you like hospital food)  misleading photos on the Trip Advisor site showing a food area  no parking  and nothing to show that the owners have put any at all to improve it. I booked on hotel.com and was disappointed. For the price one does not expect a 4 star facility. But one would expect more than what this hotel provides.Thank you for your review. We are sorry to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us. The Inn is older. . .many of our guests find it charming and comfortable. The setting is more residential  off the main shopping/activity corridor but convenient enough you can still walk to Pike Place Market or the Convention Center. We are very close to opening our restaurant and I apologize you did not enjoy the room service selection provided on our menu. We are very proud to be a part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center campus. About 40 of our guests are tourists and 60 of our guests are here for medical related visits at one of the three major medical facilities in the area. And we are happy to welcome everyone. We wish you safe travels!

The 1st time I stayed in this hotel was last year and I was immediately impressed upon entering the facilities. The decor in the lobby is very inviting and clean which provides for a very welcoming environment. As soon as you enter the staff on hand immediately greet you and ask what they can assist you with. All of the staff that I have come in contact with are very professional and eager to help. The actual rooms in the hotel are also consistent with the lobby...very clean and decorated with modern yet classic pieces. Not to mention the hotel is walking distance from EVERYTHING may it be the BART  Chinatown  Little Italy  Fisherman's Wharf etc. The surrounding area of the hotel is very safe and clean as well. Anytime I go to SF I plan to stay at this hotel. Also during my trip this past weekend a group of friends joined me and they stayed in the hotel as well. They also gushed about how conveniently located and cool the ambiance was. You can't go wrong staying here!Thank you for coming back to Galleria Park Hotel and making our hotel as your home away from home. I shared your kind comments with my staff. I am extremely proud of our team in the front office as they are indeed one of the friendliest and most professionals in the hospitality industry. Last year  the California Hotel Lodging Association awarded the Galleria Park the Best Service Award and it's because of our employees who care about our guests' stay.I hope to meet you personally when you return to San Francisco!Best James

It's definitely not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton but whenever you book this hotel the rate will likely be much lower than most others. If you're coming to the city to hang out in the hotel room then don't stay here....if you need a clean and safe place to sleep and cleanup at then this is the place for you. Free parking and an unbeatable location.Definitely get a room in the back of the hotel. Rooms are small but not claustrophobic. 15 min walk to Union Square. Located by several fantastic shops and restaurants.

We stayed here  because it was basically in the middle of everything we were doing in 2 days. The staff was super friendly  the room was perfect  breakfast in the morning was great  and the shuttle service to the Space Needle was a nice plus. We got checked in by 11 am  which was great  because we had a day full of activities planned  and it was nice to get our stuff put away so we could enjoy ourselves.

The hotel sits on Brickell Key overlooking Biscayne Bay. We stayed in a room with a terrace and enjoyed sitting on the terrace looking at the lights at night. Wonderful!

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,From the moment we arrived at this property we began to fall in love with it. Check-in included a complimentary glass of bubbly --always a nice start to a new relationship. We booked a first floor room that was to our liking  all the conveniences we enjoy. Abundant foliage makes it seem like a secluded nature preserve. The restaurants offer good cuisine as well as plenty of atmosphere. Our favorite place for dinner was the patio of the Mustangs and Burros restaurant. As dusk arrives  the fireplace is lit and the warmth and light adds to an already great experience. The weekend we were there  the hotel hosted five weddings.Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star feedback with us on Trip Advisor. We agree  a glass of bubbly is always the best way to start a relationship and we are elated to hear you enjoyed it. It is an absolute pleasure to read your commentary regarding you dining experience at Mustangs Burros as well as the beautiful atmosphere the resort has to offer. We certainly hope we are able to welcome you back in the near future  and want to thank you again for such a wonderful review.

If you stayed at any of Disney's resort hotels  you would be further away from the entrance than you are from this one. It is located just behind Denny's which saves you from the noise of Harbor. The hotel is an older one but we did not find it run down. The rooms were recently redone and the plumbing  heat (didn't use the AC)  refrigerator and TV worked great. The place looked like it was recently painted and the carpeting looked new. The walls are a bit thin but with only 65 rooms it didn't matter. The plus side of being an older place is that the rooms were large in comparison to some of the newer places. The breakfast is nothing to write home about but it is better than others I have had in the area. I would recommend either Denny's or IHOP. We didn't use the pool or hot tub but others were and seeming to have a good time. When booking at their website  be sure to check for the specials which do not automatically come up on their reservation system. We found that we could get a 20 discount if you stayed three nights but had to call to the hotel and ask specifically for it to get it. It was worth the phone call as it brought our hotel bill down to 62 per night. We will stay again.

Also  it has a decent gym and the location is also good  maybe 15min walk to Union Square. On the other side  if you are in the wrong room  you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though  the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available  they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night  I didn't sleep more than 30 min. After complaining  they gave us a different room which was much better. But why not giving us a quiet room in the first place!Dear Tim E Thank you very much for your review I am happy to hear that we were able to accommodate you in a quieter room resolving the noise issue. I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay  and we hope you will be returning soon to the Hotel Vertigo.Warm Regards Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,I stayed here recently for a business trip. The pros: location  food  nice rooms and amenities (comfortable bed  hot water  quality soap  shampoo and body wash  in room coffee). Most of the staff is great. I had a bit of a scratchy voice when I misplaced my room key and the front desk guy handed me a bottle of water and told me it sounded like I needed it which was so thoughtful and above and beyond. Kudos to the staff! I ate almost all my meals here  and was very impressed by the food. The cons: when I checked in they told me they could not find my reservation (I was part of the group). People spell my last name wrong a lot so I asked them to check that as well and she said that it was not listed under the incorrect spelling either. I wound up having to go to another hotel because the hotel was booked which was very inconvenient. Turns out they did have my last name spelled wrong  and the front desk clerk must not have checked throughly or cared. The next day I found out they had me listed as a no-show. All the other employees I met were super friendly helpful and thoughtful. I was able to check in the second night as another group had left and my company figured out the error. Since the rooms face the atrium  it can be a bit noisy especially if there's a function downstairs.Overall  I would stay here again  just the check in process was disappointing and made things very inconvenient for me for the first day I was in Atlanta for my conference. I am so sorry for the error in finding your reservation. I will share your feedback with my team and appreciate you taking the time.

1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,This was our 2nd time staying at Ocean Park Inn. Again  we stayed in a 2nd floor ocean front room. Great location  right on Pacific Beach. Very comfortable  fabulous ocean and beach views  balcony with small table and chairs overlook the beach. Unlike last visit  this time the wireless internet was completely useless in our room. I mean like non-existent. I had to go to the lobby to use wifi. Pretty inconvenient. They likely need to install few more routers. This reminded me of the state of things 10 years ago when you'd wander around a hotel with your laptop  trying to find where you could actually get a wifi signal.. Spacious bathroom was renovated since last visit: bathtub removed and replaced with very spacious shower stall. Lots of drawers  decent closet -easy to keep organized. Pool  hot tub and patio area were great: impeccably clean: Staff were often out there picking up towels and tidying up. We swam in the ocean everyday  used the pool and hot tub every day. Very friendly staff. Location is as good as it gets: right on the beach  and walking distance to dozens of restaurants  bike rentals  coffee shops  and beach-and-souvenir shops. A Ralph's supermarket is a 3 minute walk away -great for lunch fixings  fresh fruit or a quick dinner from the deli counter. Free breakfast on site was good:: kids like to make their own waffles  good selection of yogurt  bagels  cream cheese  hard-boiled eggs  fresh fruit  toast  jams and cereals  coffee  juice  milk. Never used the air-conditioner: enjoyed sleeping with sliding doors open  fresh sea breeze and the soothing sound of ocean all night. Not a luxury hotel  but it has everything you need  except useful wifi  is very quite and clean  has friendly staff and location couldn't be better. Teenage kids would like to return a 3rd time  maybe next year.Thank you for all of your positive feedback  we are so glad that we had the opportunity to welcome you back!I have wonderful news  we are currently working on upgrading our Internet. On your next visit to the Ocean Park Inn it will be running much quicker so you will have more time to enjoy relaxing out on your ocean view patio!

The hotel offer a complimentary breakfast with a wide choice of food to set you up for a busy day ahead. The pool and gym area were great and were in use until late which was excellent as a way of unwinding after a day at the parks  my favourite being the hot tub in the evening  which was hot  hot  hot The location of the hotel is perfect. A two minute walk to the hustle and bustle of international drive  with all it's attractions and the i-ride  but just far enough away for a peaceful nights sleep.All staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful  nothing was too much trouble. A HUGE special thank-you to Jennifer on reception for going that extra mile when helping me organise my trip to Miami  and to Ravin and Alain for your help with my return flights.We hope to return next year and would recommend the hotel to anyone planning a holiday to Orlando.Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review.

As we arrived they offered us sparkling wine and water  took us to our room which was lovely  and showed us around. We took advantage of the free arrival margaritas  as low point  as I think they forgot the tequila!  but it was a nice offer. We also used the jacuzzi which was clean and nice in the evening with candles and a fire in the pool area. Everyone was super friendly  and the facilities were great  although they were being re-modeled at the time  which wasn't the best. We ate at Adobe El Restaurante for breakfast which was absolutely delightful. We would definitely recommend a visit to this charming hotel.Thank you for taking the time to write such a fantastic review. Im glad you had a chance to enjoy things like the whirlpool and breakfast in Adobe El Restaurante. You will have to come back and visit the Spa next time  it is going to look great after the enhancement project is complete in just a couple more weeks!

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,Booked one night on priceline since my usual hotels were full and didn't feel like using Hilton points. Will never make that mistake again. Pulled into hotel lot on a Saturday night about 10:00 p.m. Lot was COMPLETELY full even at that fairly early hour  lot spaces are very inadequate to the number of rooms. Finally managed to find a place after circling four times. Just as I was only pulling my bags out  three cars in the lot  all vehicles carrying gangbanger types drove by (looking to park at the hotel  not leaving)  looking at me and scoping out my car. Similar type patrons in the lobby and around the exterior corridors of the hotel. I am not shy about travel  I have walked and worked in rough downtown areas  but I do expect to feel at least a modicum of safety for my person and belongings/vehicle. As I was walking to the lobby  two police cruisers came into the lot  one to circle  the other to park for awhile. At that point  I had it -- I informed the management that I would rather waste my priceline bid and go stay somewhere else  which I did. I am very disappointed that a Best Western would allow this activity on its property. The police did not seem to act like this was an isolated incident  but rather one of their regular patrols. I do not leave a negative review unless I feel it really warrants it  and this one wins first prize for me. I will never book this property again  let alone stay here. It is unsafe-feeling  and I would never take a family here.On behalf of myself and the entire staff here at the Best Western Inn Miramar  we are saddened to hear that a guest was displeased with his recent experience at the hotel. We pride ourselves on excellent guest service  beautiful and comfortable accommodations  and a safe and pleasant experience. The location of this hotel is in close proximity to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and is a very safe location. One of our most respected accounts is one that is with a Marine Division on this base. During the evening this guest checked in with us we had a large group of this Marine Division staying with us. We feel privileged to have the Marine Division stay at the Best Western Inn Miramar. They are the very men and women who protect our country and we are honored to have them at the hotel. They are often times not in military uniform during their stay at the hotel but are by no means gangbangers. They are polite  quiet  and very respectable guests. We have a very close relationship with their command and have never had any problems with them in the many years they have used us as their preferred hotel. To ensure the safety of all of our guests we have area officers occasionally do courtesy visits to the hotel as they do other hotels in the surrounding area. The Best Western Inn Miramar is in a very safe area and is located in a county with a dedicated and very courteous police force. There was no activity going on at the hotel and we thank the police for being kind enough to check up on us once in awhile  stop in for a cup of coffee and say hello. We appreciate their service.We are sorry that the guests experienced anything but absolute satisfaction during his visit as it is our goal to provide nothing but the best for each and every one of our guests whether they are business men  military soldiers  sports teams  or family vacationers. Each and every guest is important to us!Manu PatelGeneral Manager

Upon check-in  I wasn't quite sure how the visit would turn out as there was a heated conversation going on between a disgruntled customer and the desk clerk. The family had made a reservation for a one-bedroom suite and were assigned a studio instead. I understood the family's frustration after a long day of travel and I was a little concerned that I would not get the type of room I had reserved. Thankfully  the room we were assigned was great. The one-bedroom suite was very clean  quiet  and comfortable. We had a great night's sleep  enjoyed the free breakfast (which was pretty standard)  and headed off for Port Canaveral. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,I have to be honest that from the outside  the hotel seemed a little scary and outdated. Once inside  however  it was one of the most modern Marriott locations I've stayed in. The lobby area was welcoming and there were plenty of areas to hang out with colleagues in the evening. And the rooms were equally modern and larger than average. My only complaint was that the bathroom was extremely small. I highly recommend this location for small business conferences given its proximity to the airport. The shuttle came in very handy for conference attendees.Dear BFR1920  thank you for taking the time to write your experience while staying with us.

In a junior suite this trip on the 14th floor and accommodation is great  fantastic view of the Bay.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,After reading the reviews on trip advisor before departing  I headed straight to my travel agent to enquire about a transfer to a different hotel  but was persueded to give it a try. So armed with my bleach wipes and can of oust we arrived at the hotel. However  I need not have worried  as I was not greeted by a musty smell at reception  not rude staff. I entered our room apprehensively  and although it was very dated and basic  it was perfect for our familys needs. Cleanish  with a fridge and tv  room service everyday  and friendly  helpfull staff.The free breakfast was ok for a few days of the holiday  but there are only so many meals you can eat off of a polystyrene plate lol. The best thing about the hotel was it's fantastic location. Situated right behing a KFC  and Walgreens 24hr supermarket and right in the middle of International drive  we couldn't have asked for better. Universal is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel  but it's a lovely walk with beautiful gardens and little lakes on the way there. You are also only 2 minutes away from Wet Wild and a whole load of shops and restaurants.The transport links here are fantastic all the way up down I drive  and the stops are seconds away from the hotel. The free shuttle bus can be very busy  escpecially in the morning and on the 8pm and 10pm return buses from Disney. If you're only off to Aquatica for example  you are better hopping on the I trolley as it only costs 1.25 and your almost always guaranteed a seat.The pool at the hotel is open until 11pm  and its heated  so a welcome relief to your sore feet after a hard day at the parks or shopping.All in all  I would possibly stay here again. It is basic  but from the other reviews I have read  it is no more run down than the more expensive alternatives.

The service is the only thing I would say that stands out.Thank you for your post. I am glad that you found the hotel convenient and the service levels exceeded your expectations.

The room was very quiet despite being on the I-4 side of the building. I was very impressed that I couldn't hear the cars/trucks going by at any time while in my room. Had a problem with the TV which turned out to be an old battery which the staff dealt in a timely manner. The staff was very friendly. The one negative was the free breakfast. This is more an indictment on the the guests than the hotel as the meal was simply mayhem. The staff couldn't keep up with the number of people eating. It always bothers me when people don't clean up after themselves. I would definitely stay here again but will most likely eat else where

When I arrived  the valets seemed annoyed that we did not pay for valet parking. On previous visits  they were extremely gracious and did not mind that we self parked. Hotel reception was very professional but again  something was off. I am not slamming the hotel  just noting that something has changed. I ask the management to please review your previous management style and return to that management style My wife also commented that something had changed. It is still a very nice hotel and the rooms are very clean and pleasant.

At check in the lady (I am sorry but I dont recall her name) was sheer professionalism and charm. Clearly she has been here a long time and made fell very welcome. The rooms are excellent and spotless. Self serve drinks and snacks after 3pm are great and breakfast is excellent. All other facilities are great and internet/free printing very useful. The location is great - far enough away from the noise of Bourbon St but only a 5 minute walk. Convenience store 3 blocks away and downtown shops  etc close too. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.

Breakfast was great each morning and the complementary food was a nice touch later on in the day (By the front desk) We wanted this location because it was close to the park  gulfarium  Meehan's   and Skyview.Dear Mattme34 Im so glad you enjoyed your trip to Atlanta. Thank you for pointing out our convenient location to a few of the local attractions.We hope to welcome you back soon! Hospitably Yours Andrew May General Manager
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square  your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas  Puma  Bloomingdale's  etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room  the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha  I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof  there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel  so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive  it didn't bother us one bit  except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator  big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv  everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose  cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room  there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website  the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble  the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo  clean as well  no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends  seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel  it is in an incredible location!

This hotel is in the Central Business District about a ten minute safe walk from the Quarter. Courteous helpful staff  clean and very nice room and hotel.

When we got there we were greeted by a lovely young lady named Ingrid. Let me tell you she was so helpful in getting us a room because we arrived early and showing us where to go and where not to go. Every one of her recommendations was a HUGE SUCCESS! She really is someone who takes pride in her job and she does her job very well. Honestly even if the hotel wasn't as nice as it was she made it worth it being there. You felt like you were going home to your house every night  the staff is soooo wonderful. Never had a better experience staying somewhere. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The old school feel was cool also. The restaurant next door called the Chop House was the best steak I have had in my life. Must try it I you stay at the hotel or love steaks! Dear Mark G  We are thrilled to read that you had a wonderful experience at the St. James Hotel. Thank you for taking the time to share the details of your stay and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to our great city!We will be sure to share you kind words with Ingrid and the rest of our staff and are so glad that you enjoyed our location  rooms and restaurant.

0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The biggest problem of this hotel is the location  the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general  rooms are very tiny  it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep  have shower and not more than this. So  If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights  it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed  that the district is full of homeless  hookers  drug dealers and junk. However  that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.

A couple weeks ago my boyfriend surprised me with a trip back to our favorite San Diego hotel. We spent the first night lounging poolside with another fantastic burger dinner and drinks. Brian  our server  made us feel welcome right away and recommended the curried carrot soup to start - not something we would have gone with  but it was absolutely delicious. The following evening at sunset my boyfriend surprised me with a perfect proposal on Sunset Cliffs! Needless to say  we were on cloud 9 when we arrived back at The Pearl. The staff picked up on it right away and made our night so incredibly special. Brian was our server again and excitedly brought us complementary champagne to celebrate. While we had dinner  a couple of the staff snuck into our room (which was totally fine with us) and set up a bucket of champagne  some glasses  and a couple of awesome I The Pearl shirts with a handwritten note of congratulations! The Pearl staff went above and beyond  and these gestures really made an amazing weekend that much better. Their thoughtfulness has become a part of our engagement story  and we can't say enough how much we appreciate all they did for us! Thank you Adrienne  Maggie  Brian  and everyone at The Pearl!PS - Oscar the fish was a great roommate!Thank you very much for the awesome review. First and foremost. Congrats on the engagement!!!!

The best part was the evening cocktail party for the entire hotel. Every evening everyone is invited to the lobby for a complimentary drink of prosecco. Not my favourite drink but fun. You do have the feeling that it was from a different age. PThe rooms were well done and quiet. Friendly staff although I got the wrong directions to the subway to Ohare when I was checking out and one of the bartenders does not know anything about wine  which is odd given how much they are charging for it. Fairly minor issues. The wifi was really hard to use at first. They say it's free and it is but they want you to fill out this form on-line asking way to many questions and very personal at that. I refused and called their support line and the guy was very helpful and gave me an access code that was not given to me at checkin in. I was very annoyed that they were trying to mine data from me that way. I have not seen a hotel do that before and I thought it was sneaky and inappropriate. I thought the cost was very reasonable and the location is great  easy access to the downtown and a good distance to the west loop which now seems to have the best restaurants and a very vibrant atmosphere. I would go back for sure.

We had a roll away bed in the room and it had bed bugs  which means they can be anywhere in this hotel. Not getting much of an answer from the Hotel manager on this one  was supposed to call me but hasn't. Our toilet was broken and had to be plunged three times while we were there  we just gave up and used the toilet in the restaurant downstairs  which was hard to get to because the elevator was broken the entire time we were there. Not a great experience. The photo is actual if I wanted to fake one off the internet I would pick one that looked worse  actual bedbug bites from The Sheraton Four Points New Orleans on Bourbon St.We inspected every roll-away bed in our inventory and found no infestation of any kind. We also checked for substances that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Again we found nothing. Our hotel is regularly serviced by a reputable extermination organization that provides reports of any pest findings. We answer all consumer concern calls but no one has attempted to contact me or my management staff on this matter.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,I'd always stayed in downtown when I visited Seattle  but decided to try something different this time  which led me to The Sorrento. I couldn't be happier about my choice. The First Hill location is quiet  mostly residential plus a couple hospitals. It's sort of between Capitol Hill and downtown  which are my favorite neighborhoods and within walking distance. Immediately near the hotel  there are Starbucks  Top Pot Donuts  McDonald  Walgreens (I think) and Bank of America - all that convenience! The hotel itself is full of old world charm w/o feeling stuffy or dated. Its restaurant Dunbar Room was excellent - the ambience and hospitality actually reminded me of New Orleans. I stayed at the junior suite - it's big and has a lot of nice details from a design standpoint. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  which made my stay even more wonderful. My only frustration was weak  spotty WiFi - it could just be that particular weekend but I'd keep in mind if you travel for business and WiFi is crucial.Any comparison to the Big Easy I'll take!

The front desk staff at this hotel are great and go out of their way to do anything they can to provide you with a pleasant stay. Free covered parking and a great location just off I-5 was a big plus. The free high-speed internet and breakfast are nice. The rooms are large  comfortable and quiet. When I return to the San Diego area  I will be staying here.

Great bar with pretty good bar food.The bar tenders were super. Place was very clean.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I recently spent several nights at this hotel while attending a convention. Let me get the negative out of the way: my room was tiny.I don't know if I would have received a slightly larger room had there been a second adult on my reservation  but my first thought when I entered the room was that I was glad I was alone because there was not enough room for two people's luggage.But once I got settled  I was cozy and happy in that room. I was not bothered by noise from the hallway. Both room and common areas were clean. Hotel staff were gracious and friendly. Water pressure was fine.The convention center ( and the Museum of Modern Art) is a 10-minute walk from the hotel  which is faster than taking a car  and 10-15 minute walk to other hotels that attract conventioneers. Easy to get an Uber if you want to get to other parts on San Francisco. Plenty of places just a few steps away to get an easy breakfast. They have a laid-back happy hour in the early evening which is a nice little perk. Overall  I would just say that I felt very safe and welcome in that hotel. I would definitely consider it for a future visit in the financial/convention district.
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,My room was outstanding! It was about a 30 minute drive to ski in Alta or Brighton  and the room was 1/4th the price of hotels closer to the ski areas. The bed was comfortable. The room was spacious. The kitchen was more than adequate. I will likely stay here again in the near future.
1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Looks very nice from the streets  but not a clean place to stay. Went to use the microwave in the lobby a guest was using it before me she standing in front of the microwave with the trash can throwing up in it  the microwave was dirty inside.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,This hotel is conveniently situated near the Riverwalk Convention area as well as the Bourbon Street area. I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean  nostalgic  and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel  they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there  I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street  but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A  but no contruction on the weekends! I believe the cost was very good for the accommodations and service.

Plenty of outlets close to the bed for charging all of our devices. The curtains would open or close with a touch of a button. I'd definitely stay again!!Dear knottjustphotos  Thank you for taking time to write a review of your stay at Conrad Chicago AND specifically mentioning Lexy - she will most certainly be recognized for making your stay memorable!

No one would take responsibility of any kind. I called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. Finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when I was to attend a wedding. It didn't happen. Bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. Both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. So 6 flights of stairs every time. What was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.Dear TravelingJeffry Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Hyatt house Seattle. I am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. I can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. Also that I did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us. If you choose to stay with us again and I hope you do give us another opportunity then please reach out to me directly and I will ensure your stay is wonderful.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I picked this location because it was close to MCO  relatively affordable  and had a free airport shuttle. The room was ok  though is showing wear (for example  bathroom tiles were cracked and some grout was missing). The linens were very cheap and coarse (I quite literally got rug burn on my elbow from rolling over in the night). The shuttle to the airport in the morning was fine  but I couldn't get the front desk to stay on the line long enough to get picked up from the airport after returning my rental car (seriously irritating when someone answers the phone and immediately puts you on hold before taking 30 seconds or less to understand the reason for the call). I spent about 10 minutes on hold (despite trying to call 3 different times) and eventually took a cab to the hotel (which annoyed the cabbie greatly since it was a short fare).Given this experience  I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's the cheapest cost. It was reasonably quiet and I slept ok all things considered  but there are several options in the immediate vicinity.Dear Falconsview  thank you for sharing your experience and for being our guest. While overall you had a pleasant stay  we are unhappy with the lack of service received from our front desk staff. Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences that you experienced being put on hold for so long.

What an amazing change (and I usually don't like change when I find a cool hotel) that has been made by the Valentino group! Renovations are a success and the staff is above and beyond (especially Jenna at the front desk). One thing people need to understand when staying at these cool boutique hotels in the quarter...they are old buildings  the rooms are small but well worth every penny. Our room had a king bed and that did bode for a tight room but it faced Decatur Street and we just loved everything about the room. I can't recommend this place enough without realizing that I've just given away one of our favorite places to stay in the quarter.

They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd  I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No  we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no  fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day  you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic  but they did offer you alternate accommodations. We try to honor early check in requests  but that is dependent on the departure patterns and how quickly we can clean the rooms for the new arrivals.

Everyone on staff we very friendly and polite. The room that I had stayed in was very cozy and relaxing. With nice  soothing colors that didn't look too plain. It was nicely decorated. Everything was great about our room. Our floor's bathrooms had not been remodeled yet  but I can not wait to go back to see what they look like after. The location of the hotel was ideal. It was just a few blocks away from Union Square  so we were able to walk right there in less the 5 minutes.

Of course  being right in the city  we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for 20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State  and a great way to end our vacation.Since we left the car with the valets (and didnt want to pay for parking around the city)  we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel  and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks)  but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks).We stayed on the 8th floor  looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.

She did all the leg work  provided me with contacts for music  hair  minister  everything. Since this was a destination wedding that was incredible. She is my fairy Godmother and provided my husband with wonderful wisdom. The staff helped with everything from unloading the car to decorating to rubbing my feet!!! They even danced with us in our second line parade. I highly recommend this hotel  I will never stay anywhere else in New Orleans ever again. They really treat you like family here!!!We are thrilled you had such a fantastic wedding experience and stay with us! We certainly loved having you!!

The stay there wasn't bad at all  well....that's until I got home and two days later I check my bank account to see that I was charged for a total of 3nights instead of 2. When I called to inquire about this. I spoke to Jenny  the same nice cheerful rep I saw when I checked in. I guess that was a front! She was very RUDE! She was talking over me and insisted it was a bank error and not Hampton Inn fault. She kept saying what does your reciet say I told her the recit states the correct amount  however  I was charged a addional night. She still was rude and nasty! I asked ti speak to the geneal manager  and she kept saying she was in a meeting. I told Jenny how this has compromised my account and I need reinbursement. She hung up on me!! I will NEVER stay there again!! I advise everyone to check your account twice! They will jip you!!Dear Guest Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimiter Center. I am sorry that you felt that Jenny our guest service agent was rude to you. I personally looked at your account and you were charged the correct amount for your room. As per your request after speaking with you I called your bank and had them remove an aurthorization amount off of your account that your banking institution was holding. I am sorry that this was an issue while a guest at our hotel. We hope that this clears up any misunderstanding and hope that you will choose to stay with us again.

Near Fillmore Street (genuine american  San Francisco Street  full of live  no tourists).If your budget is low  and you are not very ambitious with the room  is one the cheapest way to stay in SF.

The spacious rooms have everything you need and the staff is very friendly. The pool bar is a total bonus. Sebastian and the rest of the bar staff are very nice and attentive. The place has a cool  hip vibe but with out the South Beach attitude. I would definitely come back here for another weekend getaway and recommend it to people looking for a fun  easy place to stay in Miami.So glad you selected the Vagabond for your staycation! The locals have discovered how relaxing it is to hang out by the pool during the day and enjoy the pool bar and the entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights.

The well-trained staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were fine  although some higher fiber cereal would be nice. We did not sample the free dinners (Monday to Thursday). We would happily stay here again and plan to recommend it to family and friends. A minor complaint: the internet was S-L-O-W and needed to be re-approved each day. It also appears to be very family friendly. We don't believe you will be disappointed.

There was no remote for the tiny television  the towels looked worn and unclean  the mattress was as hard as a rock  there is no ventilation (no ac  no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering  I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time  and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.

Brochure online pictures show rooms with balconies  no balcony!Parking is extra and if you are not happy with your stay and want to leave early  they charge you an early checkout fee ! They brag on the renovation they just had. Our family can only wonder what condition was this place in before undergoing such a huge renovation they speak of.I think they spent it on wall paper and carpet.We have lived in New Orleans have also visited many times since moving away.

I hope the previous guest was charged because the room stinks. When I booked last October guests reported renovations going on. I thought by July it would be completed. They are still renovating and the hot tub is closed. Our kitchen looks like the material was saved from the 70s.

But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes  blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out  the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room  we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip  I booked two rooms. Upon arrival  The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair  toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room  on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk  the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning  sounding genuinely concerned  and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point  the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude  and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel  please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process  poor service  and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest. We appreciate the honest feedback and hope you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations on a future visit.

Understandably  people will make noise in hotels  and it's something any hotel guest has to deal with. This is ridiculous  and if my only recourse is to point out how little the staff here cares about an unpleasant stay for guests  then I will do so in every available forum. Thanks for avoiding this place and not contributing to tolerance for disrespectful people. If it was just loud TV noise or whatever  I could deal  but this is constant running  stomping all evening long  and its not something I can tolerate.The Value Place team deeply apologizes for your negative experience during your stay with us.

Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car. The longest was during our check our which is around 10:00 AM when we waited at least 40 minutes  I guess its the check out time.We are delighted that you found our associates friendly and accommodating. We appreciate your feedback of your stay. Thank you for your perfect review of Marriott's Grand Chateau.

I left later on Saturday evening and I knew I would have a late check in so I called and let them know. When I arrived at 12:47 AM Crystal(I think that was her name I was tired) at the desk said my name as if she was expecting me I had called 5 hours earlier and spoke with someone else!She checked me right in and I was in my room on 2nd floor by 1:00 AM. This is my second time staying here. I like the location as it is close to the fwy's that I need to access that lead me to three different locations to where I needed to be. All areas of destinations were within 15 minutes of this Best Western  which to me is most important for what I do. I was just saying to my wife that I would stay here again with her and kids if we came in for fun. Mind you  it is not a beach resort location  but if you are in San Diego for multiple activities  I would recommend staying here. Parking has been good and I don't find myself constantly looking out the window to check on my vehicle. No squirrely people lurking throughout Hotel. I travel often on weekends  and it seems sometime Motels/Hotels can be party spots...not here  quiet on my last two visits.I come down to San Diego at least 3 times a year for business and will continue to stay at this Best Western in the future.FYI  They have coffee all night!

The rooms could use a little updating . The bathrooms are starting to show their age. The staff was very nice. I asked to be moved to a harbor view room and they were very helpful in making that happen.The continental breakfast was really good. They had many wonderful choices of both hot and cold items.The yogurt parfaits and the pancake machine seemed to be very popular. Our room on the 5th floor had a spectacular view of the harbor. The hotel really does have a great location. It has a pool and hot tub. If you stay there take the time and go for a walk on the harbor. this property is located near the zoo and sea world. If you need to unload your luggage. Make sure and park out front and use the lobby doors. Otherwise you will be hauling your luggage up some stairs. The parking garage is located off the back of the lobby and you need to use the stairs.Thank you for sharing your experience with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.

The rooms are clean  large and well decorated-exceeded all expectations. The breakfast is good. Not fantastic but a nice way to start the day. The super bar is friendly and reasonable-we did not try the food. The location is excellent-Seattle is such a good walking city (this was our first time)- its walking distance from most places and still in a pretty quiet spot. Our room had a view of the Space Needle. What makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. The people were simply fantastic-truly customer focused and just plain kind. We had booked the rooms nine months in advance at a 40 discount from the current rate . We were meeting other friends (mom and two teens) that had booked air bnb. By 11 pm they still had not been able to reach their host and were threatening sleeping in their car. Because we had a suite that sleeps six  I asked them to stay in our room. I went to the front desk to explain the situation  ask for bedding -credit card in hand. They were wonderful. They saw how desperate we were  chuckled and smiled and asked what kind of bedding we needed and waved away my card (hope I am not getting anyone in trouble). The bedding was there in 10 min. Ive never experienced such warm hospitality and I am truly grateful. Thanks for a memorable and wonderful visit!

1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Stayed here overnight when a flight got cancelled. PROs - Great Staff  Clean  Close to ORD. CONs - Charge for Wifi  No breakfast  Cost.First the pros - my wife left her credit card in the room. After discovering two days later  she called the hotel. The card had been found and turned in and locked in the office safe. The director of security verified the info and shipped via Priority Mail back to us at no charge. This is unprecedented service and one we'll be forever thankful for. The room itself was exceptionally clean and well-appointed. Also  it's only about a 7 minute drive to ORD.Negatives - 12.95 charge for wifi is ridiculous in this day and age (I'm guessing because they can) there are relatively no restaurants around except for the wonderful Gino's East next door. Also  the cost was a little out of line for a close airport property.Dear Gatoric:Thank you for writing about your stay with us. I am happy to hear we were able to hear that we found your credit card and that you enjoyed the staff..Like most full service hotels of a major brand we do bill for services such as breakfast and internet separately from the guest room. From your note I gather that you prefer to have all inclusive pricing when you choose a hotel. There are a number of Marriott brands that will perfectly meet your preference such as Courtyard Hotels  Residence Inn and Springhill Suites. There is a Residence Inn near O'Hare as well as a Springhill Suites (which is located just 1 mile from our hotel.) I can recommend all of them. Thank you for staying with Marriott!

To make it worse there were other customers complaining. It had nothing to do with the pool remodeling. Mold smell and unkept rooms. We got moved to 3 rooms and finally decided to check out!

A very old building with a very new flair.Very Mercer-New York like. Modern. Everything was new  comfortable  worked. Granted there's no view  but why do you need a view when you're in San Francisco Go walk!Convenient to everything. Especially the lively Union Square. Great restaurants  the nightlife. Are you kidding For these prices You have to be nuts to stay anywhere else. I'm shocked that this is ranked (as of this writing) 47.The hotel front desk was very friendly and I even bought a DIVA T-Shirt (okay  okay  so it says SEXY on the back)Try it out. It's a hundred plus bucks in San Francisco! I saw these prices for Labor Day and am trying to talk my wife to going back. (She wants to go to Palm Springs. Ugh!)

You end up paying for internet AND parking which raises the prices even higher. Your only in your room to sleep most of the time.This was an excellent hotel and as far as cleanliness  customer service and additional services... this compares to many of the higher end hotels I have stayed at. The rooms were just newly renovated to brand new and clean. Fridge  microwave  large TV and comfortable bed and free internet (fast too).Free breakfast (lots of choices) and free garage parking. Right across the parking lot is a gas station with fast food and lots of snacks and beverages for those late night needs.Simply excellent.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful  her attitude was too good at all  she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad  outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.
0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,We stayed at the Hyatt House for five days at the end of June  a scant two weeks after the hotel opened. It is located on Fifth street and fronts Seattle Center.Room: The room was well designed. It is designed for longer stays and thus has some basic utensils  cook top and dishwasher. We didn't do any cooking but it was convenient to have a freezer compartment that actually worked. We availed ourselves of some ice cream from downstairs and kept the remainder in the freezer for the next night. The bed was very comfortable  better than most hotels. The shower was large. We saw some electronic controls on the wall that simply said My. It turned out that they were for the electric blind controls on the windows. It seemed to us that travelers shouldn't have to guess what controls in a room do. They should be labeled. This is a small complaint for a room that otherwise was well designed and quiet. We slept well here.Internet: I tested the up and download speeds and got 33 megs down and almost the same speed for upload. Very good internet function and was easy to logon.Housekeeping: We did not get any housekeeping one night and on another a harried housekeeper who was supposed to get off at 4 PM knocked on our door at 830 PM and asked if we needed service. They seem to be short of housekeepers and it struck us that they are asking the housekeepers to do too much. I suspect that they are not paid enough either. Morning Breakfast: The breakfast was quite good. We often stay at the Hampton Inn down the street and the food here was much better quality. You even get real scrambled eggs here versus egg food. The juices were good and cold. They have an innovative cooling table that all of the juices sit on and it worked well. The design of the eating area could be improved. Sadly  now that this hotel is open it will be unlikely that changes will be made. They store the plates overhead in the middle of the buffet line. It is an awkward place to have them and would be difficult to access for shorter customers. The buffet line area is too narrow. When people are on the omelet side they often bump into the people on the other side. This seems like an odd oversight. You would think architects for Hyatt would have this down by now. Overall though  the food was quite good and included in the price of the room.Hotel design: The main lobby area is quite pleasing to look at and use. There are ample chairs with modern design and were quite comfortable. The check in desk was ok but I often wonder why they make their staff stand all day. Hyatt could take a cue from Hilton hotels in this regard. The snack kiosk next to the check in desk was well stocked and we used it several times. The hotel elevators are inadequate. They only have two elevators. There often were lengthy waits  particularly on the weekend when the hotel was fully booked. This is another flaw that can't be remedied and it is a surprise again that the architect failed so badly on this item. There is only one elevator that goes to the parking garage  the one on the left  again a miss. The garage is oddly designed  probably because the hotel is on a triangularly shaped lot. Even though we had a compact car  the parking spaces are far too narrow making it difficult for parking and getting in and out of your vehicle. You also have to make a 90 degree turn to either enter or exit the garage  This is after you descend the steep entry. There are some large bolts protruding from the card reader mount at the bottom of the garage entrance. Since you have to make a sharp turn on leaving I can see that someone with a larger vehicle may run over one of these and puncture a tire. Fortunately for Seattle  it snows infrequently  but I could see where some blowing snow could drift down into the very steep parking garage entrance. Someone entering could then slide all the way to the bottom where they would hit the roll up door.Staff: The staff were pleasant and helpful. They looked fatigued and understaffed. I suspect this will improve as the bring more employees on board. We saw one manager who was on duty all day and was there at least until 10 PM when we walked through the lobby. He was there again the next morning when I left the hotel at 0800.Miscellaneous: They accept dogs here. There is a 75 charge per stay. This seems steep if you only stay for one night. We had no problems with our golden retriever and it was conveniently close to the Seattle Center for dog bathroom breaks. Pickup bags are available on the street. Summary: We would likely stay here again when we visit Seattle. I suspect the start up problems will be resolved soon. The morning breakfast was quite good but they need to resort things so that access is better. The rooms overall were great  well designed and comfortable. The staff are harried  hopefully they will have an adequate number of employees soon. The hotels in Seattle seem very highly priced. Our room was 254 and I see now that the rate has risen to 400 per night. Enjoy your stay in Seattle  this is a hotel you would be very comfortable staying at!Dear Thomas K Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your visit on TripAdvisor.

The decor is unlike any other Hampton Inn we've stayed in...dark wood  different types of lighting  very convenient for someone traveling on business. But a few shifts of furniture (a rolling desk and chair in the room) created a nice little nook for our 11 month old to sleep in his pack-n-play! The rooms were very sound-proof  as the baby woke in the night crying  and my parents next door did not even hear him. The hotel staff was friendly  and the breakfast was  as usual  great!

We stayed on the 7th floor suites which included a mini fridge  microwave  and front lounge area with separate tv. The staff here is awesome. The plus for us is  this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom  you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk  this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near  but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast  nothing fancy... eggs  sausage  waffles  fruit  cereal  grits  biscuit and gravy. From 530-7p they have happy hour which includes 3 drinks.

Room was spacious  but unfortunately  I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location  as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further  the water pressure in my room  located on the 10th floor  was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well  as I had a late check-in (10pm)  and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar  which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma  the pleasant check-in receptionist  asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger  more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa  thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle.

They gave us a different room. When we got to that room  it smelt like smoke and not mold and again bugs all in the bath tub! Just a gross hotel.

The hotel is located just outside the gates to Chinatown and we were able to walk to the Embarcadero  Pier 39  Coit tower  Golden Gate state park  etc. The rooms are a little smaller than other hotel rooms we've stayed in however the bathroom was quite spacious. I am very particular about cleanliness and this hotel was clean  new  and well run. Comfortable beds and pillows  free movie rentals! The only thing missing would be a nice hot tub on the roof! I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in San Francisco!

The majority of the staff at the front desk was helpful EXCEPT two women. (the one that usually works in the morning (Katalina)  and the African lady that works at night after 11pm). Both have ghettoish attitudes  and they argue with customers. They must be miserable with their lives  but they should not take their misery out on customers. This hotel is located in one of the prime areas in Atlanta  near a few big corporations  and it's unfortunate that you have these classless women  who are both extremely unprofessional working at the front desk at this particular location. They are a bad representation of your company -- no class at all. Two bad apples ruins the bunch. I give this place two stars. Hire people more professional people with better customer service skills.

Property is convenient to downtown Dallas  but expect a commute time since I-30 is a very heavily traveled route into downtown. If your actually trying to get downtown - take the Commerce Street Exit and avoid as much of the mixmaster as possible.Staff was friendly  efficient and there always seemed to be someone cleaning. This property did not offer a complimentary shuttle service for the area attractions  which was a bit untypical for most of the properties we have stayed at of theirs.There are a few close restaurants/fast food choices  but don't expect a suburb metropolis of choices.

However  if you are a normal human being and expect clean sheets  and not pubes stuck to walls and absolutley filthy carpet that trust me you can SMELL has NEVER BEEN CLEANED..and just a HORRID room full of bed bugs  then you will not want to stay here. Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels  we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink  and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains  and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all

We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad  with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty  there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds  as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.

The hotel is located right next to I-5 so be aware that there could be a noise issue if you are sensitive to that issue. There is a 24-Hour fitness located across the street that you can access for a fitness center which would be great if you were staying for several nights. The breakfast was hot and the staff was attentive and making sure that all dishes were filled promptly. The room was comfortable - basic  but spacious for our night. We walked to a nearby restaurant for dinner and passed several others on the way. Like many downtown locations  I was comfortable walking in a group  but wouldn't walk alone. Close to several outdoor type stores.

The free breakfast and dinners allowed for a lot of flexibility- we could grab something to eat without wasting any vacation time. The room kitchen was completely stocked with a full size refrigerator  stove  microwave  dishwasher and a full set of dishes  utensils  coffee maker  toaster  cutting board  can opener. A stop at the nearby Walmart and we were set for the week. The staff was very hard working in the dining and pool area- food and towels were constantly replenished respectively.

Here are some tips/info you should know: It is right across the street from a facility where the homeless get services they are always hanging out there. The closest BART station  Civic Center  pops up in the middle of what could be called a homeless tent city. As a woman with 3 children traveling with me  all wheeling airport bags  we were very out of place walking to the hotel the kids were terrified. I felt much safer walking to the hotel from the west side-Van Ness street where there is great access to public transport.I wouldn't rule out going back to the Monarch on another trip if I needed a budget hotel  but I wouldn't bring kids there I'm not sure I'd go alone.Erica H Thank for such a well-thought out and kind review.

The hotel staff were super nice and efficient  especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast  as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer  plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless)  so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes  trolley across the street  a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here  and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager  but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient. Good job!!

Dirty bathroom sink  dirty floors  and common hallways trash and laundry is left out by hotel room doorways for hours  even overnight. I also carry Clorox wipes  and need every one. AC did not work called no one ever came to checked the AC sent a written list to manager. NO RESPONSE! Manager must think if they change their name  the bad reviews will stop and they can get away with disappointing more people who visit this lovely region. No hangers in closet  closet door was pulled off hinges  and we stayed in what was billed as the King Suite ( most expensive room rate) thinking we have a lovey spaces to relax in at the end of our day. Wrong! Noisy things banging and outside the windows was mechanical area. Go anywhere but here!

Though very close to Disney  it was less then ten minutes to SeaWorld and only about a 12 minute drive to Universal Studios. The road the hotel is located on can get you to all the major parks without getting on the interstate.We had a one-bedroom suite which worked out great. It was a nice property and well-maintained. The pool and other facilities were really nice. Daily housekeeping was wonderful. It was very convenient to have a kitchen and full sized refrigerator since we were there for the week. If you are going to Orlando to do the parks  I highly recommend this property.

Use the CTA train from Terminal 2 which  for 5 dollars takes you to Clarke and Lake where the hotel is situated just down the street  a 3 minute walk. This worked well for us.The hotel is clean and rooms comfortable but is showing signs of age in some of the dcor but perhaps this adds to its old world charm. Staff were pleasant and helpful and complimentary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch.There is no restaurant at this hotel but there is an arrangement with the restaurant next door. We were catching a night train so didn't get to try the breakfast.The bed was comfortable and was welcome after a long flight.Complimentary dressing gowns in the bathroom offered that little extra luxury.The mini bar was extensively stocked but like all hotels  expensive!I'd certainy recommend this hotel as a base for exploring as anywhere downtown is within easy walking distance and local transport for further afield is easy.Good Afternoon A charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!

Hertz rental car is also based in the car park of the building  so really convenient if you want to drop off or pick up a rental. Staff all really helpful and really pleasant.

1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,My husband and I booked a room here over the past Thanksgiving for two nights when we flew in from North Idaho to celebrate the holiday with our son and his family. The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge  Molly  who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping  eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet.

The somewhat unfriendly front desk agent informed me I couldn't do this as only online reservations were eligible. I took the elevator to to 4th floor to find I had been assigned a room facing Bush street on the 4th floor. The main issue was it was opposite the stairs and elevator  which meant lots of noise. I returned to the front desk but was informed they could not change rooms as they were sold out. Needless to say I didn't get the best nights sleep.I travel to San Francisco several times a year but will not be staying at the Rex or any other Joie de Vivre properties.Dear Nick Thank you for taking the time and post a review about your stay at the Hotel Rex on Tripadvisor. I'm truly sorry that we were not able to find a room to your liking. I can assure you that it is our highest priority to train our staff so that can provide excellent service - something we obviously failed to do during your stay.We genuinely value the feedback our guests provide both when we get it right and when we fail to do so as it is extremely helpful for us to discover areas in which we need to improve our service and operations.Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.Kindest regards Lorenz MaurerGeneral ManagerHotel Rexlmaurerjdhvotels.com415 217 4023

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,We ended up staying here as a result of a long delayed flight back to the UK. The property is really nice  the rooms were large and we had two adjoining rooms one with a large king sized bed the other with two singles. The rooms are spacious  light and clean and the bathroom was really big in the king room. TV channels were great and I do like the Marriotts inclusion of Netflix on the TV's too. We ordered room service as we were really late  despite being past 11pm we were able to order an item from the pre-11pm menu. The two dishes were both seriously good and way beyond what I'd ordinarily expect for room service. The burger was succulent with a good bun and crispy bacon and I really recommend the Chef's special sandwich the brisket is to die for. Don't go for the chips though as ours were soggy. We arrived for breakfast bang on 10am having been told breakfast finished at 11am - which the ala carte does but the buffet finishes at 10 however the server and staff allowed us to continue with the buffet. All the food was great and the ability to have freshly cooked scrambled eggs is a real plus. We used the pool area  being able to swim inside and out was fun for the kids as was them watching me go from jacuzzi to pool as I invaribly froze! We had lunch by the pool  which was served with a good portion size of hummus and meat platter  the flatbread pizza was good with a very tasty sauce. The standout item for me though was the service. Service is so important and every single staff member we encountered appeared to go out of their way to please us  it was a great pleasure to stay at a hotel where the staff really were very accommodating and helpful and for this reason I would really recommend this hotel to anyone in need of an O'Hare hotel.
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,I've been a fan of SpringHill Suites since staying at one off the strip in Las Vegas. We choose this one in Seattle because we've had good success with previous SpringHill locations. The hotel is about a mile away from both the Space Needle and Pike Market. We walked once from the Needle back to the hotel and it wasn't too bad of a walk (one mild hill.) The other times we took the free hotel shuttle which will drop you off and pick you up at these two landmark attractions. The neighborhood around the hotel isn't the best  but I've seen worse. We felt relatively comfortable/safe walking around the area and ate at the Pho restaurant one block west of the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street to the South of the hotel but it may only be open on weekdays as it is attached to an office building. Compared to the hotels nearest the city's landmarks and downtown  the price of SpringHill Suites was less. The buffet breakfast (hot and cold items) was good  though it can get crowded. Luckily  the bar area provides additional seating at peak times and they will open the conference area for seating (if nothing is scheduled.) My only gripe is the cost of valet parking. It comes with the territory (in-city accomodations) and was quite a bit cheaper than hotels right at the city center but I still don't like to pay for parking. Very close to I5 with very good access to I5 South on ramp.This is a really great description of our services  David -- thanks so much for taking the time to share this with those looking into our hotel. I'm happy that you were able to make good use of our shuttles to see the city  although I wish the price of our valet parking hadn't been a disappointment. As you mentioned  valet parking is an inevitable part of city life  but hopefully our other services more than made up for it. Speaking of which  good note about our breakfast -- we can get a little busy  and it's a helpful note for fellow travelers. Hope to see you on your next trip to Seattle! All the best Frank F.

0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,We have stayed at this property for years and loved it  but noticed that it was going downhill over the past couple of years. After our last stay  we were so disappointed that we decided to try a new property for our next vacation. Based on our last stay  we have the following comments: * Pool area: Very few lounge chairs  most of which are broken. This is not a new problem...it has been ongoing for years. Smoking is allowed in the enclosed pool area  which poses a health and safety hazard especially for small children. During our last stay  there was a man that parked himself at one of the tables all day and smoked cigars. Since we were travelling with our 1 year old  we asked if he wouldn't mind refraining from smoking while we were with our infant  but he continued to smoke. Since smoking is allowed in this area  the hotel chose not to take action. After moving  we were still in the path of the smoke  plus another guest chain smoking cigarettes. There is a seating/table area just outside of the enclosed pool area that would be better if guests need to smoke. Perhaps management could consider making the enclosed pool area non-smoking  replace the broken lounge chairs and offer more seating. The pool itself was great  clean and child friendly.* Evening meal: This was the most noticeable decline. Almost every night offered a meal with cheese  with no alternative for those allergic or lactose intolerant. We had individuals in our party  along with other hotel guests who were unable to participate in the evening meal due to allergies. Previously  whenever the entree offered cheese  the salad bar was a garden salad with a variety of add-ons (including cheese on the side). The salad bar has since disappeared. During our last two stays  both the entre and salad contained cheese and was offered at least 3 times per week. It would have been nice to return to the hotel and enjoy a casual meal with our family and other guests after a long day out. Since you're provided with a menu for the week  we knew in advance when we had to eat out or pick-up dinner. Perhaps management could consider limiting the cheese entrees to once or twice a week (as in previous years) and offering a salad bar and breadsticks (without cheese).* Breakfast: In previous years  the hot breakfast was very good with variety on a daily basis  but would now consider it between average and poor. The variety has declined with the same offering on consecutive days. When cheese eggs and grits were offered  there was no substantial alternative. We've also noticed that Styrofoam plates were often substituted for real plates over the past couple of years at both breakfast and the evening meal.On the positive side  the hotel is in a great location. We loved that it was away from the busy areas and offered a quiet stay. The rooms are large and for the most part clean. The furnishings have seen better days  are not terribly comfortable and small for a family  but okay for the amount of time spent in the room. The staff was great - at check-in and breakfast.We will miss the Homewood  but can no longer justify staying at this property. The cost has also increased over the years although the cost to include meals may be used to justify the price increase  it wasn't worth the additional cost (as per above) as the meals lacked variety  did not consider allergies/intolerances and were overall substandard. We just returned from our vacation at the new property and have to say that we will not be returning to the Homewood. The new property was fabulous - larger suites  the pool area was clean and spacious with a significant amount of seating and the entire complex was non-smoking. We felt that we spent our vacation at a resort and were pampered. The best part is that we saved over 30 per night in comparison to the Homewood for the same time period.
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The only concern that I had was the cleaning service left our hotel room door open while we were away. When we came back  luckily nothing was missing. I would suggest using the safe the hotel provides at NO additional charge.All in all  I found that for the price the location was great. It is directly across the street from the tram entrance and main gate entrance to the two parks. The best thing I found was the Denny's restaurant located at the entrance to the hotel parking lot.

One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value  space  design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay  from wake up service to the little touches  they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes  please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget  do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.

They are slightly small but this is typical for hotels I have stayed in in SF. The discreet in-room recycling bins were a nice touch.Hotel Facilities: Not much. There is a very small fitness room and 'business centre'. We didn't use the restaurant - there are excellent dinning options very near by. The staff were helpful. Location: Great location near Union Square and Chinatown. SF is a very easy city to explore - tip: buy a MUNI pass and use it hop on and off the regular busses and the cable cars  too!

The bed were comfy  and the room quiet despite being right next to the hustle and bustle. The only down side was that breakfast was a little thin for my liking: AMAZING fresh croissants  jam  coffee and jam. Would definitely go back again!We're glad you decided to stay with us after your last-minute cancellation!

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,Thanks to American Airlines I found myself stranded in the Windy City for one night. First a faulty door  then poor weather and then returning to the gate to refuel (surely they should have thought about that one). Either way I wasn't going home  but heading straight for the Marriott O'Hare in Chicago  which  while on one level  not a great thing  on another  it meant I could mooch around Chicago for the day  which I did.The Marriott O'Hare was very much in the corporate mould  the sort of place where I find air hostesses normally Asian checking in ahead of me and sure enough there they were  but the check-in procedure was remarkably smooth and helpful. However  finding the room and then finding my way from the room back to the front desk area was tricky at one stage I was lost in a maze of corridors and had to retrace my steps back to the room and then start again  taking a right turn instead of a left. But this was a minor problem in the scheme of things.The hotel room was very nice. Too many pillows on the bed  but then all Marriotts seem to suffer from that affliction. There was WiFi  but it wasn't free which I always find a diabolical liberty and  oddly  it's always the big chain hotels that request payment  the ones that  arguably  don't need the money. Smaller hotels seem to offer it for free and  let's face it  the Marriott could too  but it chooses to charge. It was all academic to me as the airline had checked in my bag  which contained my laptop  so I only had the business centre on the ground floor  which I would use the following day. In fact  on the subject of the business centre  it was fine and they allowed me to use it AFTER I had checked out  which was kind of them  so I did get my free WiFi after all. Extend free internet access to the rooms and you'd get a 'very good' rating from me.It was late or getting late by the time I reached the lobby and took a seat for dinner  although only a limited menu was available to me. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and the fish dish and it was fine. Breakfast the following morning was excellent they had everything and it was all top quality. I ordered fresh fruit and some bread plus a bowl of cereal (something like Alpen) along with a pot of tea. But once again  where the tea was concerned  I remembered that if I fancied a decent cuppa I would have to wait until I reached England. There's never a pot of tea in the USA  but there's more likely to be a pot of hot water and a teabag in a sachet and that was the offering at the Marriott. But again  not a major worry.There was a shuttle bus to the airport and  after mooching around Chicago (definitely not my kinda town) I'd driven back to the Marriott in a taxi (having taken the CTA into downtown from Cumberland  a station across the parking lot from the hotel) and sat at the bar with a glass of Cabernet awaiting the call from the shuttle driver. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and takes about 20 minutes to reach the airport.I'm one of those people who tend not to like the corporate hotels  but then  everytime I find myself in a Marriott or a Hyatt  I have nothing but praise for them perhaps I do like corporate hotels and that 'brand reassurance' they offer. I could have done with another night at the Marriott O'Hare and  preferably  under calmer circumstances. Marriotts are good hotels. I liked the Cleveland Marriott and the one in Atlanta and I'll forgive them leaving too many pillows on the beds. Keep up the good work.Mr. Moggridge! Thank you for writing about your stay! I thoroughly enjoyed your writing and thank you for the positive comments. As well as noting what we could improve on. I hope this note finds you at your destination. Wishing you safe travels and a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl

He was miraculously familiar with the nature of my work and my recent health condition  and I was touched and delighted to find that while I was out  he tailored our room to accomodate my special needs so that I could thrive  personally and professionally  during my stay at the Kimpton Allegro. I look forward to staying there again during my next visit  and I hope he gets a magnificent raise before then. Also  the beds and bathrobes were supremely comfortable. 3Hello!

0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,The hotel is located on the southeast corner of Walnut and West Katella (opposite of the Disneyland property on the Disneyland hotel side  to the right of the Denny's restaurant). The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful  clean  and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast  however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars  juice boxes  fruit  yogurt  and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property  and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine  snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise  this would not be a good room for you. However  if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room  you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV  is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table  there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board  iron  suitcase stand  and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror  sink  box of tissue  hand soaps  microwave  single serve coffee maker with packets of tea  coffee  and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet  it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it  the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head  pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area.

One thing that will mention  if you're expecting the room to be dark so you can get a good night's sleep  you might want to try somewhere else. The blackout curtains don't close the entire way  so instead they have some kind of plastic shade that you pull down that does nothing. A little bit after 6am it was extremely bright in the room so we were unable to sleep. Oh and the barn door for the bathroom is really noisy in the middle night so if you have an infant/toddler  go somewhere else. This hotel is close to Publix  right off the I-4 exit  you can walk to Bonefish Grill 7-Eleven and they have a free shuttle that takes you to Seaworld and Pointe Orlando.

The Room- If its comfort you want  its comfort you get  the beds and pillows were off a very nice quality. The television worked fine  yes you do watch a little t.v on vacation. Lighting was good in the room. No safe that's a shame. Good shower pressure  but the hot water was not as hot.  one mention of this to reception  it was taken care of. management does listen.!! Location is excellent  right around the corner  lots of eatery  TGIF restaurant is okay   big selection. but the asian buffet is better  for 12 all you can eat. Check it was easy enough  alain was very nice  and helpful. The room had a musty smell   we did not complain    opened the window   within a day it was gone. Breakfast--- ahem      well     like in previous remarks from others    its definetly overcrowded     which is annoying   but this morning into day 3   they opened up a meeting room    for a overflow   yeaaaa   what they should do is build a makeshift extension close to the pool    for the overflow  . The breakfast is poor    not enough variation  what would it hurt to make a few salads    it would go a long way   think healthy.So in the mean time    This is a good hotel.... good value for the money   nice staff    lino at breakfast is very helpful. Enjoy your vacation    the hotel is good for all   families  couples    worth the price!!!

And we did not regret it! :)It set a good start for our Seattle trip - we arrived a few hours earlier than the usual check-in time  and when we approached the reception to check-in  we were told we can do so right away - that put a HUGE smile on our face  since we've been up since 5am to catch our flight and we were totally worn out! Excellent customer service!This is an updated classic semi-luxurious hotel - I personally love the building  the hotel classic decor and settings  the room is updated and yet classy  clean  spacious and unlike other old hotels  it does not have that 'moldy' carpet smell. The room comes with your own freshly ground coffee and french-press.:)The location is great - within walking distance to literally everywhere. We walked to a whole lot of places  i.e. Pike Market  Capitol Hill  etc... we even walked all the way to the Space Needle!There's a li'l bar inside the hotel and I did enjoy a couple cocktails there. There's also a bar across the street called Quarter Lounge  check it out. And if you need pharmacy or coffee fix  they are all along the Main St right outside the hotel. Very convenient.Hope this helps. :)Wow! Thank you for such a great review.So glad you enjoyed your stay! Hope to see you again soon.Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel

I must say from start to finish I was pleased. (And I tend to be picky). The man Jesus that checked us in was very friendly. My request to have an upstairs room was met. Our room was somewhat large. It was a big square and had two queen beds  a fold out leather sofa  and a dining table with two chairs. The square shape of the room made it feel larger. The air quality was improved when we turned on the AC. The room did smell a little humid prior to that. The beds were COMFORTABLE. The TV had a good selection of channels. The room had a microwave and fridge. They had a free breakfast with pastries  waffles  boiled eggs  and cereal. No water though only juice and coffee. Denny's is located in the same parking lot so if you want a more full service breakfast it is right there. We did not use the pool but it looked well maintained. There was a parking attendant 24/7 and they were helpful. We stored our stroller in the car to avoid taking it upstairs. I will be back. Thank you for a great last minute stay. Thank you for writing us a great review  I'm glad to know you enjoyed your stay with us. Our close proximity to the parks at a reasonable price makes us an ideal hotel to stay at. We hope to see you again next time you are in the area. Sincerely  Parveen

Also I had 2 reservations-1 for personal (for the first part of the trip) and 1 for work and they were able to merge them so I did not have to change rooms.All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The F B Manager  Debra was great. My coworker and I needed assistance with a surprise for our team managers and she was able to accommodate our needs as well as helped with everything that we needed for our meeting-setup  lunch  etc.The staff who worked the bistro were awesome. We had breakfast  drinks and appetizers during our trip. The food was great and we were served quickly.Victor was the front desk clerk who completed my check out.

The free buffet breakfast was great. The staff was very friendly. There was a great restaurant next door for lunch and dinner. The lounge was very cozy. I felt very safe. They provided free parking were your car was in a locked parking lot. They gave us a remote control to go in and out of gate. We just had to remember to give back the gate remote. The hotel gave a friendly note under your door the morning of check out to remember. I will definitely stay again.

Made it impossible to get a hotel room. Eventually we arrived at Columbus Inn which had a free room for the night.Hotel was cheaper than others we had tried on the shore but very basic. Think we paid approx 170 for the night and do not think that this really represented value for money  although there was free parking which was good as it always annoys me when US hotels have an additonal charge to use their car park.Room was ok - had the feel that the cleanliness of the hotel was not great but did not actually have any issues. This was maybe more due to the impression the hotel gives by fact that it is quite run down. Hotel is in dire need of a coat of paint!!!Was glad that we were able to get a room here as nowhere else was available but that probably says something in itself. Probably ok if all you need for a night is a bed but thought that this hotel was very overpriced even for that.Will not be staying here again.

Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback on your stay here at the St. James Hotel. I truly appreciate your comments about our rooms  breakfast  staff  and courtyard. We also love our great location in the city! It is so nice to be so centrally located  but just far enough away from the nightlife to be able to sleep through the night!

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,This is an old historic hotel  with the expected creaky floors  but it was also just a little musty and had dirty carpet. If the French Quarter is your scene  but you don't want to be right on the loud vomit-filled Bourbon street then this is a very good choice. The location is on the edge of the Quarter  within easy walking distance of the party  Jackson Square  the French Market  and many great restaurants. Some of the rooms here are very small  while others are quite large. We wanted a balcony  but accidentally booked a sun deck room  which is nothing like a private balcony. The sun deck is a large communal patio with several rooms opening out to it  and it has tall concrete walls with no view  and burning hot sun. This room was very small  with no windows  and so we asked for another room. Even though it was our fault that we booked the wrong type of room the staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating  and they moved us to a room with a balcony - luckily one was available because we were staying during the week and not the weekend. All of the balcony rooms look out over the garden patio  and not the street  but the room was very large and bright. The garden area is small but pleasant  and we did enjoy sitting out there for our morning coffee. The free breakfast here is very minimal - breads  coffee  and cereal  so it is good for a quick bite  but certainly not something to look forward to. One of the best things about this place is the staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. Everyone is willing to answer questions  and they do it with a smile and without ever acting like they expect a tip. Of course we did tip  and they were always very genuine in their appreciation. We got great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance - one was Irene's  a popular creole restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere  but a very long wait and the other restaurant we enjoyed was Sylvain which is a small funky place with great food. Also within easy waking distance we enjoyed Mr. B's Bistro for lunch  and a glass of wine at the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone. These are all nice places for sober or semi-sober grown ups  free of loud drunks wearing beads.While the French Quarter was interesting  one day was more than enough for me. It is not the fault of the Bienville House  but the whole Quarter smells of rotting garbage and other unpleasantries. While I enjoy a drink or two  Burbon Street had absolutely no appeal to me  full of 20-somethings walking down the street yelling  carrying their giant beers/drinks  covered in beads  and this starts at 10am. If that is for you  enjoy  but I didn't need more than 10 minutes of that  so if I were ever to return to NOLA I would most definitely stay in the beautiful Garden District - there are many beautiful historic hotels here  and if you stay on or near St. Charles Street you are near the cable street car and can easily get to the Quarter whenever you want. The Garden District also has many excellent restaurants  and is close to Magazine Street  which is where the real shopping is  assuming you want something other than t-shirts with obscene sayings on them.The Bienville House is a nice place  which could use some upgrades  and it is perfect if you want to spend your time in the French Quarter  but somewhat away from the worst of it. We loved the friendly and helpful staff here  and did enjoy many good things within walking distance. However  if non-stop drinking isn't your scene I would recommend looking into the Garden District - much more peaceful and beautiful  and an easy cable car ride to the Quarter when you want it.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,This hotel has a beautiful lobby  professional staff 5 star feel. However  the rooms are small with larger than needed furniture and bathrooms that are average. There are beautiful touches throughout the hotel  great sushi restaurant (from what we heard)  but rooms their carpeting feel worn are in need of some space saving touches (like a built-in desk shelving) in order to feel really upscale. Add to that that it sits in the tenderloin district (filled with the cities homeless and drug dealers) it is definitely not a family friendly place to stay one many of you may not want to chose. We had a car  however traveled out of the city quite a bit. Otherwise  I would not plan to stay here and walk in the area  especially at night. Overall  it is a nice hotel. Room service food was way better than average the staff we encountered was the same  but you really don't see them unless you stop at the front desk or walk to the front doors. The extra fee's for everything: 16 wifi  50+ for overnight parking  20 gym fee 6 for in room water  made us feel like we were being milked and our agreed upon nightly rate turning into a never again experience. One positive note I'd like to add is that Starbucks is adjacent to the hotel  all you need do is open a hotel door you're there:)Hello MarrieinLove (I love your name!)-Thank you for taking the time to write a review. I will share your comments about the hotel dcor needing an update with the General Manager as we are always looking to improve and the concerns about the neighborhood and homeless issues in San Francisco with the City Manager.

We booked this hotel for one night (booked 2 rooms) because we had vacationed in Orlando all week but had an early flight going home the next day.......we wanted to stay close to the airport in a hotel that provided a shuttle service.

They took care of us as if we were the only ones in the hotel.....answering questions on how to get picked up after we returned our rental car  to where we should buy the cheaper gas  booking our shuttle for the airport in the morning...just to name a few things!Kudos to Sheraton for having a great team......keep up the great work!!!!Our goal is to offer a comfortable room with great service when our guests stay with us each and every time.

This is a place where I would not hesitate to bring my family.The hotel is new within the last year and offers rooms that either face the parking lot or an inner courtyard. The grounds are well maintained and parking is included and plentiful (a plus for Key West). My King NonSmoking room was large and nicely decorated in a modern motif. I was on the ground floor  but there are elevators if I was on the 2nd floor. There is a 47 inch tv with a good choice of cable channels  a desk and comfortable chair  a modern armoire  microwave and small fridge but no freezer  and coffee maker. Wifi was good. The bathroom had a large glass shower with subway tile and a large stone vanity countertop. The modern style door is of the sliding barn door type. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. The only caveat is that the A/C unit was on the loud side (57 decibels)  but I always bring ear plugs  so it didn't bother me. Breakfast was from 6-10 am with scrambled eggs  waffles  sausage patties  assorted breads  cereals  juices. The breakfast room resembles a nice restaurant and very comfortable. There are also tables outside if the weather permits. I also noticed that there was a security guard making hallway rounds on a regular basis after sunset. I really like this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a pleasant experience at a reasonable price. I will definitely return.Thank you for your comments and the details of your review. So glad you were pleasantly surprised by our amazing hotel. Thank you for staying with us and hope to see you back soon.

We stayed there from Wed. through Sat. The hotel was full  but we never heard other guests while in our room. The shower was a nice size  bathroom was a little small. Although we had an air conditioner  we liked that the window in the bathroom opened to let in some cool evening air. The mini fridge had the usual honor bar fare  but wasn't so full as to not allow us to store our own breakfast items. This was really appreciated as they don't offer continental breakfast. We only made it to the complimentary wine hour on 1 of the nights  but it was nice. We felt very safe in this hotel. Nice location  easy to find coming right off the Bart at Montgomery Station and around the corner  literally 2 minutes walk. Will stay here again when we come back.Dear bjkurth  What a great review!I'm happy to hear that we've made you a loyal guest of the Galleria Park.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,I had a nice 5-night stay at this hotel. I was originally supposed to stay for 4 nights but my flight got cancelled and the hotel  graciously and without hassle or fanfare  allowed me to stay in my same room for an extra night and for the same nightly rate that I had booked when I was making my original reservation online. My room was located on the ground floor towards the back and the only disturbance was the restaurant next door late in the evenings. However  I'm not a light sleeper so once I went to bed  it didn't bother me at all. The legendary cat greeted me when I was checking in (around midnight) and he allowed me to pet him. I only saw him once more during my stay. This hotel is very well located - there are 2 cafes within 5 minutes walk and another 1 about 20 minutes' walk away - and there's a barbecue place right next door  a diner around the corner and a gourmet pizza place across the street. I sampled them all and was happy with my meals and coffee drinks. The hotel serves a continental breakfast. It's nothing to write home about but it will hold you for a few hours and I liked the convenience of not having to go in search of breakfast first thing in the morning. Ponce City Market is very nearby so there are a tonne more food options within easy reach. My room was well kept and very clean. It looks pretty dated but is very well maintained. My only problem was that the hot water took more than 15 minutes to really get hot and since I'm not a big fan of wasting water  I ended up taking tepid/warm showers most of the time  instead of really hot the way I like it. The staff were helpful when needed but not overly friendly. I had a good stay and I would return to this hotel if I needed to stay in that area again. Oh  and there's a Publix behind the hotel  about a 3 minute walk  which was very convenient when I needed cold medicine.

We walked everywhere with ease  and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window.

We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer.

The problem that makes me feel like not staying there again is that the room was full of ants. We founded it out because theyattached all our laundry bag  in the closet. Full of cloth waiting tobe picked up. They where very small black sticky ants  those you cannottake away with nothing. I felt horrible about this. It was discusting! I felt really ashamed and didnt whant anyone to see that repugnant scene. And the room  even though it had a beautifull bathtub in the middle of the room  separatyng sleeping area from bathing area  it was really small for the price payed. Decoration was excellent. Nice colors  very relaxing. Nice vanity staff. But the ants thing   made me feel very bad!! puaj!! Never again! I cannot forget the hundred ants all over my cloth! puajj!

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The Mountainside Inn may be a bit dated  but it is affordable  clean  large bathrooms  excellent apres-ski hot tub  and only minutes on foot from lift 7. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The walk to downtown is 15 minutes  and Clark's Market is about 6 minutes. Best deal I found in Telluride  and on the river too!!
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,Location  location  location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando  and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low  and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando  who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz  but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location  it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal  and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered  the carpets had wet spots  and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell  and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards  so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy  pipes were loud  and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed  and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room  but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned  and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side  the kids loved the pool  and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old  and the chairs are cheap  but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this  and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan  none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast  milk  OJ  and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants  and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much  much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost  especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck  and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!

The only negative was that the wireless service in my room wasn't great. It dropped me several times. Breakfast was good with hot food. All the staff were pleasant and good to work with. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little on the hard side for my liking but not bad. I didn't have any problem sleeping. Our room was right next to the elevator which I usually don't like but never heard it the whole time. The fitness center had good equipment in it that worked well. There is an outdoor pool but it was too cool for a swim (though there were kids enjoying it).The price was good so I'd stay another time I'm in the area. The Village Inn restaurant right next door is a good family restaurant to eat at while staying at the Best Western. Prices were very good and serving sizes were large. We really enjoyed the personality of our server and the manager.

Check-in was nice easy and staff is friendly. Room 512 was very modern looking. There is no carpet it's all concrete floors but it does have rugs. Bathroom was nice and clean. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Only negative about the bed was the metal frame around it. We hit our knees a couple times on it so that was unpleasant. The lobby Bar was great with good happy hour food and drinks. Rail station stop is across the street. We took Lyft to the Arena which was about 5 mins away. Went to Club Luxx (which is a block away) after for a concert after party. Club was great with great music. Checkout was a breeze and breakfast in the lobby was good. Thank you Jesus!

The rooms were fine and the beds very comfortable.They have a small indoor pool  which I enjoyed early in the morning when it was empty. Though I didn't use the rest of the spa  it seemed to be clean and well equipped.The only thing that really bothered me is how they nickle and dimed you. 14.95 for internet (which we were lucky to get free as part of the convention rate) and 5 for a bottle of water that is out on the table with an invitation to refresh yourself... That said  when I checked in  the front desk offered me a cold drink  which was a nice touch.I am glad you enjoyed your visit at the Waverly and appreciate the feedback.

But the Hyatt was spectacular: We entered and we were greeted by Michael at the front desk on check in  who when he learned that it was our anniversary sent up some champagne and chocolates  the view from our room  the fabulous workout room (basically a nice gym with sauna and whirlpool)  a beautiful bathroom and just a feeling of ease the whole time contributed to our relaxing visit. The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market  A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay.

We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over. That is very accommodating for someone who may not have driven to the hotel or wants to avoid parking fees. The hotel was clean and very welcoming. The staff was very friendly and talkative too.

I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down  after the stress with AAA. Mind you  the hotel staff picked me up  even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to  it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that  you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you!

But regarding many issues  the front desk staff totally missed the mark for a hotel of this caliber. The consierge was pleasant but unhelpful. Printing a boarding pass took 45 minutes due to the staff being unable to figure out how to get the printer to work. They need to step it up. I'm sorry to hear about your experience. We regret the inconvenience you experienced with our printer. We will make sure that it does not take as long in the future. We hope you'll give us a second chance to change your opinion about our staff.

0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,My wife and I spent three nights at the Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel last weekend. We arrived early at the airport but there was no problem catching a shuttle to the hotel. The hotel representative gave us great directions to reach the pick-up point. When we arrived at the hotel  we were able to check-in early always a great treat. All front desk staff were courteous  friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Also  housekeeping provided great service too.The hotel sits in an excellent location just opposite the harbor. We were able to walk over to watch the fishing charters going in and out as well as sailing regattas on the weekend. There are also several restaurants in that area. We particularly enjoyed Mitchs Seafood.Our room was spacious and spotless. It had a small microwave as well as an oversized mini-frig. There was a desk area and  of course  free wifi was included. Each room has a balcony which is perfect in the cool evenings. From the hotel its a quick walk to a nearby Ralphs grocery where we purchased a few snacks/beverages. The ice machines always had plenty of ice.Our room rate included a great hot breakfast buffet which varied daily. There were always scrambled eggs  toast  bagels  muffins  cereal  yogurt  fruit and a pancake machine. The hot items varied each morning: diced potatoes plus biscuits gravy then sausage plus tater tots then bacon plus tater tots. The staff members did a great job of keeping items replenished as well as wiping down tables. The breakfast area is a bit small but an overflow room was set-up next door until renovation of the area can be completed.Speaking of renovations  we were amazed each morning as to the progress being made on re-doing the first floor flooring. The new flooring looks terrific! Also the lobby area is lovely and there is coffee/tea available there 24 hrs. Theres a nice sitting area by the pool/hot tub as well as a couple of tables outside the pool area.We definitely enjoyed our stay and recommend this property to others. When were next in San Diego  this is the place we will stay. Thanks to everyone for making our visit so pleasant!Good afternoon We appreciate your very extensive response and description of our property  our location  our services and the friendly staff that our part of our family her at the hotel. Also a great description of our breakfast  the restaurants near us and everything around us.Please send everyone you our way  we are looking forward to your next visit.Regards Jorge A.

I am thrilled by the service  the scale (23 rooms)  the rooms  the food (wow quality!)  and of course the pet fish in each room. They don't take pets  but provide you with one - a beta fish swims in a bowl on the wall of the room!On Pt. Loma  just blocks from Shelter Island  The Pearl is perfectly accessible  has parking right at the entrances  and had a room where I was instantly comfortable. I was totally impressed with the restaurant - including Dive-In Theater playing movies on the screen over the pool  surrounded by the restaurant. As you look for that perfect little place from which to base your stay in San Diego - search no more you have found The Pearl of great value  and you don't have to sell everything to be able to afford it!

I had researched safe places to leave our car during our cruise and came across so many mixed reviews. When I looked into staying at the Hilton Airport West  they offered a package for those cruising out of Miami that included your accommodations  full breakfast  shuttle service to the port and up to 15 nights parking. Their long term parking lot is directly in front of the hotel and is well lit. Parking usually costs 10-15 a day in most public lots and not all of them have 24hr. security. The hotel is very nice  great breakfast and they offer 3 departure times to the port. They can't offer shuttle service from the port but we were greeted as soon as we exited the port with a 10 per person shuttle service back to our hotel or airport.
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,I've stayed at Days Inn's before in other cities and another location in Orlando  and although they are not the most luxurious hotel's around  they are adequate and easy places to stay - except this one!I just checked out this morning after being there 3 days. The main problem was with checking in. Several weeks before  I booked my stay on-line at their web site  choosing a pool-side room with 2 double-beds for a price I had to pre-pay for in advance. When I checked in  they gave me a room with 2 double-beds  but not pool-side. Instead they gave me a room on the top floor of their tower  which was literally the farthest room away from the front desk. When I said I reserved a pool-side room  I was told they didn't have any. When I showed them my reservation that I printed on my computer printer after I made the reservation on-line  the male clerk working that evening (the manager) said  That's not guaranteed. WHAT When I was making the reservation on-line  you are given about 12-15 different choices of rooms to choose from  depending on type and number of beds  amenities  etc. If a room isn't guaranteed  then why is a guest given all these choices to choose from Also  if the room is pre-paid for in advance  doesn't that lock in a guaranteeThis is just the first of all the domino's that began to fall when I was checking in. With my luggage  I walked up the 5 flight's of stairs to the room they gave me to find out the key wouldn't open the lock (magnetic key card). I walked back down first put my luggage back in the car before going back to the front desk telling them the key wouldn't open the door. They called for a Maintenance person to walk up with me to the room and he tried to open the door with his master key. It wouldn't unlock. He continued to try for about 3 minutes when it finally opened  then said to me There you go. But then I asked him if I go out tonight  I don't want to stand there for 3 minutes trying to open this door  at which he replied that he would be back in the morning to fix it. As he walked away  I entered the room and almost keeled-over from the smell in it. No kidding! It smelled as though someone had deficated human feces everywhere in the room. In addition  the lights were already on  the beds were unkept  and the TV was playing. I quickly ran out and yelled at the Maintenance guy to come back. When he entered the room  he looked surprised and went to the phone to apparently call the front-desk. At this point  I was livid! I stormed out of the room  ran down to the front desk  and in front of everyone in the lobby pointed at the male clerk behind the desk and sternly said  I want the pool-side room I reserved and I want it now! He yelled back We dont have any! I don't care for your attitude with me and I'll call the cops and have you thrown out for trespassing. Then you can sleep on the street tonight! At that  I said  Fine  and picked up my cell phone to call Days Inn's 800 number with the intention of getting someone of authority higher up than this guy to fix this situation. Possibly feeling threatened  the male clerk and a female clerk pulled out a large notebook and began looking frantically through it. When I reached a human voice on the Days Inn 800 line  the male clerk said he had a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed and asked if that would be OK with me. I told the person on the phone I may be calling back then hung up. I told the male clerk that I would look at it and let him know. He made up 2 keys  I went to look at the room  then returned to the front desk to tell him that it would be acceptable. After I settled into the room  I returned to the front desk and told the male clerk I was sorry for my outburst  but that I was within my right for it because of the problems that occured. I didn't catch every word the clerk said after that  but it sounded something like You don't know what's going on around here so there was no need to act like that  which told me there may be some sort of internal  political employee problems at this hotel - but that's still no excuse for the problems I enxcountered as a guest of this hotel.When I checked out this morning  the female clerk who took care of it asked me timidly Are you still mad at us She told me she was working the night I checked in and saw everything that happened. I answered her Yeah - a little bit  and she only said she hoped I would consider returning again sometime in the future. Maybe - if they gutted the place  did a complete remodeling job and hired all new  respondible hotel staff.

The hotel itself is very trendy yet professional and business-minded. The only reason I gave the Rooms category 4/5 stars is because it was moderately sized (not spacious  not small) it had a more urban loft-like feel. What stands out the most was their service--the Front Desk was very friendly and accommodating with anything that we needed. They had some very good specials going (which can be seen on their website). The special we took advantage of was free parking  which is a real plus in the city. Their location makes them walking distance to just about all the attractions in the city. Plus  there is a complimentary Architecture Tour. We travel a lot and have stayed at many top-name hotels  and we would definitely prefer to stay here again as our top choice for San Francisco.

I had to request another room because the first was occupied. The 2nd room had a strong odor with blood throughout all of the blankets  and the Chelsea and the Annex of the Chelsea are two separate hotels. One is a motel which is the Annex of the Chelsea and the other is just the Chelsea. The parking fee is charged as if it were a resort and the self parking is located 2 blocks from this motel. Your vehicle will be out in the open without security and they do not even enclose this area with a fence. Do yourself a favor and book at another place that is not here. You will Thank me!

It was awesome to sit on our balcony and enjoy the ocean and people watch at the same time. I will mention that there are homeless people around but they are very unobtrusive and leave you alone. I never had one ask me for anything. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. There are boogie boards and sand toys that you can borrow which is nice so you don't have to waste your money and buying something you're going to have to leave. A couple suggestions for the hotel: 1. Breakfast...it would be nice if you offered gluten free muffins or cereal. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs get old fast. 2. Towel racks...More towel racks in the bathroom would be helpful. Drying swimsuits/towels and such would be much easier. Plus it would free up counter space to have the towels off of the counter.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with some helpful feedback! We greatly appreciate the helpful suggestions and will take them in to consideration. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.

While the room was clean and the location decent  the hotel DID NOT have hot water (staff claimed there was an issue). The staff further didn't take any steps to resolve the issue  it was as though I was a bother to them. I'd accept the behavior if this was a low end hotel  but this is a mid-range Best Western. Guests deserve better.I do apologize that you felt we did not take your complaint seriously. The pump went out on our boiler. We called the repair service and had the pump replaced by the afternoon.

My mom and I visit the area frequently and have tried many hotels in the Disney vicinity  both on and off site. We search around for best rates  and this location was one of the least expensive in the Lake Buena Vista area during the weekend we were there. It was clean  well-decorated  and lovely. The main dining area for breakfast was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The beds were amazing they were the most comfortable I've experience in a hotel in quite awhile. The only minor issue (which isn't really on at all) was that in the room we stayed in  the sink was in the bathroom  so my mom and I needed to wait on one another to use the sink facilities. However  it was a handicap accessible room designed to accommodate wheelchairs  so this may not be the set-up of all the rooms. The room itself was quite large and we had more than enough space for our comfort. We could have through a few extra people in the room and still have been just fine. Very clean  very modern  very well-kept. This location will go into our standard rotation for the Orlando area. Well done!

Indeed  cleanliness are standard expectations for our hotel  and it disturbs me that your experience has been otherwise. I will review your experience with our Housekeeping staff emphasizing the importance of cleaning the room the best possible way and also cleaning it on time.

When I arrived at my room there was a sweet surprise: a note to wish me a happy birthday accompanied by a bottle of champagne and a lovely cheese plate. The room was beautiful and incredibly comfortable. And the view of the city was so wonderful. They have a number you can call or text with any questions. I utilized it a few times and always got a quick response. We also had dinner at Baptiste Bottle. It was delightful. The burrata appetizer and scallop entree were so delicious. I also tried the Dealer's Roulette and the bartender mixed me up the perfect drink. At the end of the night our server brought out a scoop of delicious toffee ice cream with a candle. Everything was great except a minor mishap with the bill and being charged the wrong amount. I know it'll be resolved. All-in-all  we had an excellent stay and we would highly recommend The Conrad to others.

This hotel is very centrally located and is walking distance to so many places including Millennium Park  several boat tours  Magnificent Mile  restaurants  souvenir shops  etc. We had 10 rooms in total and everyone was very happy with them. They are bigger than the average hotel room and gave us places to gather. The various great views from our different rooms included the Magnificent Mile  the Chicago River  Trump Tower  Willis Tower and more. The hotel staff was both friendly and helpful.

0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,My stay was better than expected. It was unusual that check-in is on the top floor  but it didnt bother me (although the wait for the elevator can be a bit slow). I agree with one reviewer who commented that the hotel was a little confused on their design. The top floor (as pictured on their website) has a very nice contemporary feel a really good first impression. However  when I arrived on the 14th floor where my room was located  it felt like Gumbys grandma was hired to design it. Whoever chose this designer must have owed someone a HUGE favor because I have never seen lime green in that quantity. I would not have mentioned the dcor if I was at some cheap hotel in Vegas but I think it was strangely (and noticeably) out of place here. Despite that  the room met expectation  given the location. For the most part  it was clean and the bed was comfortable. If you look a little closer  you can definitely spot some noticeable wear and tear  but nothing that really bothered me. There were some perks that made the stay more comfortable a loofah scrub for the shower  disposable slippers and complimentary bottled water just to name a few. Outside the room  all the staff I spoke with were all pleasant and helpful. I had dinner (once) and breakfast (twice) at the restaurant XIX and found the food excellent each time. I would definitely eat there again. The location of the hotel is excellent 5-10 minutes walking distance from the Walnut Street entrance: Rittenhouse Square to the left  the Historical District to the right  the Theater District just down Broad street and the Convention Center up the street. I encourage using a taxi instead of renting a car as it looked like parking is a premium (I think I saw a sign at a parking lot that said 3.25 for every 20 minutes). One important thing: If you are a light sleeper and not used to the city sounds I recommend bringing ear plugs. The three days I spent there I could barely sleep a wink because I was constantly woken up by the sounds of sirens below (theres a hospital nearby). On the second night  I was woken up by what I think was street cleaning around 4 or 5 in the morning. It sounded like an alarm clock beeping for what felt like half an hour.I wouldnt mind staying here again if I was on business (i.e. company pays). Its a little pricey for what you get.

I had no problem with the shared bath as everything was aways left clean and neat  in fact I didn't even know anyelse had been in it.

They gave us several recommendations for restaurants nearby. The hotel is very elegant and so immaculate! Location is wonderful...close to the french quarter but in a quiet  safe area. The breakfast buffet was great and the evening happy hour and buffet was excellent too and a great added bonus. You can't beat the value of this hotel.

Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. It's in the heart of downtown  so we expected to hear city sounds from the room  but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace  though  was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping  but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant. The front desk staff was uniformly friendly  interested in helping us enjoy our stay  and full of useful not-in-the-guidebooks information. We'd return to the hotel without hesitation.

The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise  I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine  in terms of condition  apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast  which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings  there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.

The rooms are very spacious for a metropolitan area and Richard at the front desk along with Peter at the door were so helpful and friendly. There are many nice restaurants near by and you're not far from public transportation. We were in walking distance of Chinatown and Union Square. Fisherman's Wharf is about 2 miles but we had a streetcar that went directly there. When I travel I will continue to book with them. p.s. The restaurant is undergoing renovations currently but next store was a great place for coffee  baguettes  fruit  sandwiches etc. All was very tasty and not crazy expensive.

The mattresses were not quite was I am used to at other Hampton properties (not quite at plush)  but the bedding was clean and nice.

We didn't have our own car and we had our friend bring us around the city.Rooms were big enough with 2 double beds to accommodate all of us though a little dated. Not much restaurants and shops in hotel and nearby -- mainly good if you're planning to go to Universal Studios.

We arrived on Wednesday June 12th 2013. as we got out of our car the hotel staff that was present greeted us . the front desk staff got our info and had us booked in our room in about 10 mimutes.Was very friendly . I would say that the room was really more like a suite than a double room. the breakfast was very good. all in all the five days we stayed was better that some more high price other hotels. And it was located just five minutes from our kids home  with a wawa just down from it.GoodMorning Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

I called the front desk but there was no one there to answer the call. Nightmare of a hotel.

1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,My first time in San Francisco and I wanted a good central location with restaurants  bars  shopping and access to sightseeing. This was the perfect location! My BFF was flying in meeting me but her flight came in hours prior to my arrival. She text me to say they accommodated her early arrival and they really made her check in easy. Once I arrived I gave my keys to the valet and didn't see my car again until checkout 4 days later. No need for a car and parking is crazy. Just leave your car  we either walked or used Lyft. Valet parking was just under 70 per day. I found that a little crazy but I understand. The room was comfy and we had a great view of Post St. The bathroom was tiny but in reality It had everything necessary and the shower was actually great  water pressure and size. Counter top is where the bathroom was lacking. I dealt with it and was good. The main part of the room was chic and modern and there was a fridge in the room. We had 2 double beds and had plenty of room. Very clean. The staff was great and amenities were nice - computer  bar/restaurant and mini store  The Valet guys were very knowledgeable about places to eat. There were several places within just a few blocks that were really great.Union Square was a short downhill 4 block walk. The sightseeing doubledecker bus was there along with the cable car and a big shopping area with a mall and the upscale name brand designer stores. Overall  this pick was great for my first San Francisco experience and the price was just as good.I am happy to read your stay at the Courtyard Union Square was great. It sounds like you and your boyfriend had a fun trip to San Francisco. Please come again soon!

The other front desk representatives were equally unwelcoming and rude! The advertised room price was not honored at all and I inquired while they were actually putting the discounted price up! With the poor level of customer service and the false advertising  I actually thought about reporting them. It was a Vacation and I wasnt trying to spend my time thinking about legal issues. But I was apauled by this hotel. Never will I stay with them again.
1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,While in San Diego for a water polo tournament  our son's club secured a block of rooms at the Springhill Suites for parents at 209 per night (including breakfast) + 20 per night parking. Normally we are not big fans of the hotels the club selects (because the choice is most often based solely on the lowest price available) this time  however  we were beyond pleased. The hotel is relatively new and exceptionally clean  and every staff member with whom we interacted was courteous and efficient  especially so at check in. Additionally  there were many large parking spaces in the hotel's parking structure that made it a ding-free experience for our car.Our room was modern and spacious (a very comfortable kingsize bed  a large sofa  a work desk  a large flatscreen TV  a dorm-size refrigerator  a microwave  and an air conditioner that  by choice  made the room meat locker cold......sooooo good). There was also free Wi-Fi that was relatively fast and many easily accessible electrical outlets to charge our phones  and other devices. Another plus for the hotel lies in the fact that it is located within easy walking distance of many very good restaurants and the train station. Plus  for those who would like to leave the car at home and Amtrak in from Orange or LA Counties  it would be easy to do.Over all  we were very please with our experience at the Springhill Suites San Diego Bayfront.
0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,We checked in at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on October 21st we were kindly picked up with a limousine service at the Airport and greeted at the hotel lobby  the front desk assistant was extremely kind and gave us a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the wonderful Brickell bay. We had a lovely Junior Suite given that we made all our reservations through the American Express Platinum Travel Services and of course they have certain perks. So far our experience was really lovely  the reason why we were visiting Miami was because my girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was her present  aside I took the opportunity of meeting up with few business associates. During the early morning of Monday the 24th of October  I got up from the bed and was hoping to start our day  however as the blinds were totally closed the room was dark and I misstepped on some silky pillows that were on the floor  given that they never came to do the turndown of the room  (usually around 18hrs they remove the silky decorative pillows as well as the covers and prepare the room for sleep). As a result I fell head first broke the fall with my arm groping on the desk in front of the bed where the TV was placed. I was startled from the impact and due to the obvious noise I woke up my girlfriend. Once we turned on the lights we saw that my hand was slightly bruised from the impact and of course since I am not a light guy 110kg of weight the result was an impact against the TV screen which ended up broken. We had informed the room service  and security came to inquire and inspect and make pictures. More concretely 2 security staff and the manager on duty. The security staff asked some questions and provided me with some ice for the hand. They told us that it was a clear trip and fall and they accommodated us. The manager Mr. Hendrik Grebe on the other hand did not show any concern nor did he tried to communicate with us. Security came again minutes later to help us fill in a report and we of course did it following their advice. We were told that they will get back to us for the matter of replacing the tv and whatever else we could need for such incident. The evening of the same day we came back to our hotel room and found that the tv was not replaced nor has the room been made up. Moreover there had not been a single attempt to try to clarify the situation or see if we could need any further help. We contacted the front desk about the tv and we were told that they just dont have a replacement tv  instead I had to request to be moved to a different room. Approximately an hour later they provided us with the same kind of room on a different floor. The day after it was our departure date and I was having breakfast with some business associates at their restaurant and while I was walking my guest out of the Mandarin one of the security staff approached me and said that the manager on duty would like to have a word  which obviously created an awkward moment. Furthermore the manager on duty Mr. Kelvin Jiles came to speak to me and informed me that I was going to be charged 1.300 usd aprox for the tv  given that the manager from the day of the incident reported it as property damage. Of course I did not expect this  nothing was communicated to us  and no one ever made an effort to clarify such a situation. Obviously I had several questions of my own as to why this incident was treated in such a manner with the lack of communicating and unprofessionally of the Mr. Hendrik Grebes part.I was told by Mr. Kelvin Jiles that it would be possible to speak to Mr. Grebe later in the day and requested me to come back at 3pm. However Mr. Grebe never came out to us  instead we spoke to the head of security for the hotel. Previously we were able to read the internal written report supposedly written by Mr. Grebe where he defined the situation as I was caught by a housekeeping staff who brought our breakfast and I declined or pretended I never ordered  later in the report they said it was a mistake from room service obviously I never ordered such a breakfast  on top my girlfriend was referred to as a friend who spent the night in my room  also they insinuated that I could have been drunk  and worse was there could have been a case of domestic violence. That has been the most insulting situation I have ever found myself in not to say how ashamed I was when my girlfriend read such a report. I of course was told by every person who approached to us from the staff that they absolutely understand our disagreement  and confusion of such an absurd situation. They repeatedly told us that the charged were done on my card and kept on apologizing.We are usual costumers of the Mandarin Oriental more concretely we had just been 5 days at their hotel in NYC. We feel horrified at the treatment and lack of professional approach and we still havent been given a proper or justified answer to the events. I hope this long letter helps for any future similar occurrences.Dear Valued Guest Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay about Mandarin Oriental  Miami on Trip Advisor. We have reviewed the information detailing the events that occurred during your stay and your concerns regarding the charges applied to your account. Please understand the health  safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority and our personnel did show concern for your well being as well as that of your guest. While we do understand that accidents happen from time to time there are several statements that conflict with our findings and the lock audits that were done as part of this investigation which do not support that the damages were a result of an accidental trip or fall.We have sent you a separate letter discussing this situation and we hope we can work together in finding an amicable solution. Please call me to further discuss.Sincerely Jorge GonzalezGeneral Manager

The lady at the front desk recommended Cafe Mason for breakfast and it was delicious. Room was average. Bed was very comfortable like sleeping on a cloud. Our room was facing the night club so it was noisy making it hard to sleep. Other than that  I would recommend staying here.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,I made a reservation at this hotel through the Marriott 800 number using reward points. The reservation was for three people and I later noticed we were given one bed. I called back several times finally speaking to a supervisor (Steven - a woman) who was no help and then hung up on me. I spent several hours on this issue being transferred multiple times to go back to the same queue with non one willing to give me any identifier number (such as an employee number so I could document). One of the worst customer services experiences I have ever had.To be fair  we did not stay at this hotel and cancelled the reservation. It was the Marriott reservations group that earned this one star - the only one star I have ever left on TripAdviosr. I didn't even know it was legal to give three people one bed.I'm so sorry to hear of the confusion and resulting frustration caused by the reservations error. Our Central Reservations team is generally top notch and it is obvious that they dropped the ball in your case.I'm sorry you did not get a chance to experience the hotel  but we certainly hope you may have the opportunity to stay with us in the future.
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,We have stayed at this motel before so when we came back to the area we stayed again. For the price  its a very nice motel. The room was spacious and clean  the bed was very comfortable  the breakfast had a good variety of food. We were not disappointed at all and when we come back to the area  we will definately stay there again.
1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,This is the 3rd time staying at the hotel  so obviously we like it. The location is not too far from L.A. for a quick getaway. I think the price can be a bit high  we only stay if we get a good deal and so try to book early and with a AAA discount.The grounds are beautiful  it feels like a Hacienda. The pool is fairly large as is the jacuzzi. There's nice lounge chairs and it never seems too crowded. A good mix of young  old  families  business people having conferences  etc...No one will feel out of place. It is on the quite/reserved side though so I'm not sure how much kids would like it. We usually stay here with our teenagers when we're doing something in San Diego or La Jolla (water skiing  snorkeling  etc...) otherwise I think they would be a bit bored too.Food is fairly expensive  we usually try to do the Mustang's happy hour and then eat out other meals. I don't think I would recommend the food if we paid the full price vs. happy hour prices. The lengua tacos were fabulous as were the chicken wings. Moscow Mule was delicious  but it was strange they ran out of copper mugs. The bar/restaurant was very empty but they had to take our mugs from us at the table and refill for the second round. Service was friendly and fast.Rooms are comfortable  this time we stayed in basic room and didn't have a balcony which I missed. It's pretty to sit out and view their landscaping/fountains  etc..It feels very secluded. They provide you with a bottle of wine in the room which is a nice touch.Gym isn't large but has what you need- about 7 or 8 cardio machines  a few weight machines and free weights. It got a little full  but we were able to do our full routines both days with no issues.There were just a couple of negatives: self parking is so expensive at 25.00 a day. I really wish hotels would just add that in to the nightly room fee along with the resort fees. Each night ends up being 50 more when you add in extras like being able to park your car. Also they offered free coffee/tea service in the mornings but from like 5-6:30 a.m. in the morning which is insane. Who wakes up at 5 in the morning on vacation Either offer the coffee/tea at a normal time which is a minimal cost to the hotel and garners good will to guests or take it away.Dear bakeshop Thank you for being a frequent and loyal guest at Estancia we're thrilled to be your hotel of choice when visiting the San Diego area. It's wonderful to hear how much you enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of our award-winning grounds  along with the comfortable luxury of our guest rooms  and the friendly hospitality of our staff.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Lodging is expensive in New Orleans  but this place offers everything at a reasonable price. It's located on the edge of the French Quarter  so you can be in the action on Bourbon Street after a five minute walk. And when it's time to come home  you can get away from the action to relax in the peace and quiet of your hotel room. We were delighted to get upgraded to a suite  but really did not spend much time in the room taking advantage of the hot tub or other amenities. There is so much to see and do in town and the tour buses will pick up visitors right at the front door of the hotel. A nice bar is available for a leisurely drink and a free breakfast is offered featuring a variety of the usual fare. Parking is hard to come by in town  but it's available on site for hotel guests (for a nightly fee). The staff is exceptional  so just let them know if you have any questions about the area or need some recommendations.

1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,Just stayed here Feb '12. Not a horrible place for the . I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up  and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg  so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper  but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again  weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going  be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv  pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs  everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair  but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king  it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious  it has a treadmill and a bike  and a multi gym weight tower in the middle  that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries  watered down juices  do it yourself waffles  and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30  and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange  I don't think they were guests  and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again  for the price I'm really not complaining  you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel  I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.shaunbsc Thank you for your review. Since your stay  we have been actively working to improve our service level  responsiveness  and the functionality of our products to ensure things are operating as they should. We have been updating and upgrading our rooms and the general appearance of our property. I hope you have safe travels in the future. Best Regards Enoch D.

Our room was lovely  clean  small but comfortable. The bed was luxurious  lots of pillows and I think a mattres topper  in addition to being huge! The staff was great  from checkin  where Amy was as nice as can be  chatting and giving us tips  throughout our stay. Housekeeping changed our towels and replaced the complementary toiletries daily. This isn't a big chain hotel  its a historic building and it does have it charms/quirks  but to us that's what Nola is about. We will certainly be using the St James again whenever family comes to visit.Thanks for choosing to stay with us at the St James Hotel in New Orleans. We know when you are traveling you have many options to choose from when it comes to a place to stay. We are absolutely honored that you gave us a chance and took your time to write a review on Tripadvisor!!!

1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,Great charm and character inside the building . Room 252 has a balcony 2 queen beds  feature open brickwork and views of the Mississippi paddle steamers. The street cars  train bus tours all leave from across the road. No breakfast or any food is available in the hotel but there are many cafes within a few yards. There is a quiet courtyard and a small plunge pool. The room is right over the road  so you get view  but some noise too  mNy from the paddle steamer which plays an organ type calliope tune several times a day. Train noise traffic at night  so bring your ear plugs. Helpful staff. I would stay here again  its so central to Jackson square  Frenchman street  the river etc.Hi Jackie  we're glad you enjoyed your stay.

Our junior suite was comfortable  good size  quiet and immaculate. Slept great on the comfortable bed. Front desk staff was very friendly and willing to help with purchasing tickets to the Atlanta Aquarium and Atlanta History Center and even offered discount tickets. Lobby was modern and inviting. We used one of their meeting rooms for 3 days and was very impressed with the view from the 12th floor room. Pitchers of ice water and glasses were delivered every morning with a smile. Will definitely return in the near future!Thank you very much for recently choosing our Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Midtown. We are glad to hear that you and your group had such a great stay and were able to utilize our 12th-floor meeting space. We just love that view as well. Thank you for leaving your review here on Trip Advisor and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.

In order to get past the bed and the wall at the end of the bed with your luggage  you literally had to walk side ways to get by. You had to shut the bathroom door to use the toilet or shower. I have a one car garage that was bigger than this room. And the room was NOT cheap!! Absolutely terrible!! Advice - find another location.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,I can't say enough about my stay at the hotel. The staff was wonderful. Room was extremely comfortable. Loved the convenience of the walkover to AMA where I had business. Close to subway for touring downtown. The only thing that bugged me was that wifi was not free - I just don't get that these days. I did not eat in the hotel or go to the bar so I can't speak to those.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother  although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room  for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or  because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room  which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp  and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay.

The amenities they offer end up saving you a lot of money. From the high quality coffee served every morning to the wine reception every night. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful to get you around San Francisco and experience what this great city have to offer. I wholeheartedly would stay here without hesitation.

Loved The Market as we got in late and loved that we could get a bottle of wine. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the dining or lack there of. Very surprising that a hotel of this size doesn't have room service and food (besides breakfast) is only available from 4pm-10pm. And the free breakfast...not good. Watery eggs  dry (turkey) sausages  extremely dry Canadian bacon and no real bacon! There was cereal  yogurt  waffles different bread products  and strangely  Thai curry soup with rice every morning. Where are the biscuits  gravy  bacon Washington is still in the US  right There are no close breakfast options either.

Only downside is the AC was broken and the beds are only just above average. Overall love it. P.S. dont park at the hotel. 24/7 secure parking is one block up at 6th and Market for 38 LESS per night.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Check-in was a breeze and had no problems getting to our room. The lobby displayed a classic 1920s hotel style  as well as a grand staircase. The hotel's elevators are room key activated only  for safety reasons. We had a smoking corner room on the ninth floor and there was no trace of smoke anywhere in the room. There was clean white sheets on the bed and clean carpets. Also to our surprise  there was a door that led out to a balcony (we was one of the two rooms to have this.)  which I enjoyed being a outdoors person. The bathroom was clean and spotless. The shower provided shampoo  conditioner  and body wash  although I brought my own. The 5:30 Kickback in the lobby was like dinner to us. There was hot dogs  chicken tenders  cocktails  and liquor (2 for every person and show your room key). The pool and hot tub were clean and pristine  although I didn't use it. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. The fitness room had a bike and step machines and two treadmills (a somewhat small room  though). The general manager and his staff were great to us. I will recommend this Drury Hotel and will stay here again when I come back to NOLA.

It was a short walk from the Sante Fe station  a short walk to the Westfield Mall and the Gaslight Quarter  a very short walk to Little Italy and a 20 minute walk from Petco Park. We took a bus to the San Diego Zoo from the Sante Fe station. San Diego is a lovely city for sightseeing and getting around easily.The hotel was lovely  we had a room overlooking the harbour. The bed was large and very comfortable. The pillows were also good. It was always clean.Breakfast is served in the next door restaurant and we found this to be good. Always got a table. The buffet items were plentiful and we have no complaints. It saved us trying to buy breakfast at extortionate rates elsewhere. The staff were all happy and helpful. We would stay here again the next time we visit.Thank you for reviewing your stay at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn.

Saw this hotel online and called to see if they had a military discount. The gentleman who answered the phone gave me the most amazing deal! We got a family suite for the 6 of us for less than the price of a single room. The pool was great for the kids to play in when we weren't at Disney. The front staff was very nice and even let us check in 9 hours early for no additional cost (we drove straight from Washington and were exhausted). The continental breakfast is nothing to write home about  but it was food in the belly before trekking around Disney all day. As 2 families splitting the cost of this amazing deal we were able to have lots of extra money to spend on our week long trip here at Disneyland. We stayed May 2015.Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad you found our hotel a good place to stay.

And to add to this there is never a point where I have ever questioned the professionalism in the team.Moreover  the hotel itself  although it is nearly 20 years old  has not aged a bit. Another thing I love is the beach from where one can see skyscrapers or the sea and it gives you the feeling of being on a Carribean getaway  although being in the middle of Miami.My regular room which I stay in also has brilliant views of downtown Miami but also the ocean. Needless to actually say is that the rooms themselves are one of the most well kept I have seen when comparing to other 5 star resorts.All in all  one can read from my writing that I am a big fan of this hotel and always will be because I have been a customer there for ten years and they have never disappointed me!

0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Seven of us flew into Seattle relatively late in the day and stayed overnight at the Four Points. The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel  in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review.

It is a bit of a walk from Canal but you are saving hundreds. Just make sure you watch the parade in a spot where you can freely get to Rampert and are not barricaded in on the wrong side of the street. This is a clean sufficient hotel that will allow you to have money to spend on others things. You will be just fine walking down Rampert at night. Checkin was flawless. Thanks Best Western for the very good first impression.

We were in the last building close to the pool and spa. Sadly  the walk to our room entailed walking through long corridors of indoors rooms through two buildings. There was a beautiful courtyard area in each building but it was not designed so that you could walk outside in the lush gardens :(The valet staff was the most helpful. Giving us water and directions when we needed them. The staff at the front desk were cool and impersonal.The pool was very pretty and our son enjoyed swimming in the salt water. It definitely felt like an adult hotel and not very kid friendly.Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience. We value all of your opinions and thoughts.

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,In a city not known for sumptuous hotels  the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large  well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg  as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street  while not of the same caliber  has infinitely better views. So  ask for floors 14-20. Below that  it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now  for the good stuff: Nice pool area  very good spa treatments  and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic  with SF Moma half a block away  and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall  a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel  but definitely the best in San Francisco.

With your stay  you get a free breakfast  an early evening snack which is pretty much a meal  three free drinks per person per night  a rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi and close proximity to much in New Orleans. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season  holidays and days of the week  but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online. Our room wa well-appointed  classy and comfortable. This hotel will only get better after all renovations are complete. That they accept pets makes it all the better.

The rooms  the fitness equipment  the catered meals  the staff all top line. My room had a wonderful view of the ATL skyline  and being attached to Lenox Square is always a plus. Our catered buffet lunches were superb  and the staff attached to our meetings were very amenable. We typically stay closer to the airport  but I am so very happy we came to Buckhead. I ate downstairs at the bar one night  and only OK food  but being as this hotel is so close to really good restaurants  it is not important to eat there  anyway.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,This is one of my favorite hotels to visit. It's a beautiful and tranquil property  with stunning views of the bay from every room I've stayed in. I typically travel to Miami for work and always prefer staying away from the craziness of South Beach. The Mandarin offers a respite from the rest of the city. The standard rooms are huge  with beautiful details  great bathrooms  and fantastic views from the balcony. The restaurant in the hotel is delicious  too. It is very pricey though - but worth it if you can splurge and want to stay outside of South Beach  for a different Miami experience.

Lobby can be loud at night with everyone enjoying happy hour.The gym is very nice  but a little tricky to find in the pool area.Concierge lounge is nice  but tiny. Great food and service.We had a meeting here  and they did everything they could to accommodate us and our needs. I asked for a Diet Sierra Mist  and they brought me 4 of them in a bowl with ice  and a glass with ice.My only complaint would be the shuttle ride to and from the airport. Its is long  and makes many stops  including to the Marriott O'Hare Suites. If time is on your side  or you are totally cheap  take the shuttle. However  if you want to get into your bed and be to sleep as soon as possible  take a cab. It runs between 16-20 bucks.Dear sttcarrie:Thank you very much for spending the time to write about your stay and your very positive experience with your meeting. Indeed the travel time to the hotels in the area is lenghty at times  the airport restrict all shuttle pick up to only the bus center in terminal two which creates traffic jams at times. We do run our shuttles every 20 minutes throughout the day and make every effort to be on time. Thank you again for staying with Marriott!Wishing you happy holidays and safe travels.

The rooms are tiny  and we asked to be switched to another room because the air conditioning unit was so loud. The 2nd room was equally as bad. I work in the hospitality industry and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Hi Zanzibella - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. While our rooms are cozy in nature  as Chicago's first Silver LEED certified hotel we're proud of our eco-friendly efforts. We appreciate your candid feedback about some items not being to standards in the room  such as the air conditioning. We will certainly ensure these types for things are checked daily so as not to occur again. We hope to welcome you back in the future.

I was on my way to take my last final for the semester  I walked into the lobby and asked was there anybody to help change a tire. The agent at the count was an angel  and said  sure give me a minute. Then a young man came over to me and introduce himself as John. John said  I'm here to help you with you car  at that point we both walk out to my truck. John  asked if I had a jack or anything else to take a tire off  well I didn't. John with so much patience and great customer service  said Don't worry I'll find one. Then John and Reuben came over as a team and blessed me to get back on the road and on time to school for my final. I am so very thankful and blessed for that experience at the FairField Inn. You are the Best. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. CarmenHi Carmen John and Ruben are awesome! I will be sure to share your comments with them along with the rest of the team.

The staff was friendly and very helpful.As with everything in San Francisco it was expensive but the hotel lived up to its good reviews and was close enough to walk or ride cable car or F train to most destinations. We used shuttle from airport to hotel and never needed a car. The location is right in front of China town so very easy access and a coffee and bagel shop on every corner so quick breakfast is no problem. We stayed here on the tail end of a Maui vacation and wished we had just stayed in Maui. But this is no fault of hotel just personal preference on more relaxing vacation in Maui as compared to having to rush from point to point in San Francisco. Also Maui much more affordable that San Francisco  never would have thought that. Hotel great if this is the type vacation you desire. Great staffDear Mark Thank you for choosing to stay with the Orchard Garden Hotel. I am pleased to find that you found our team very friendly and helpful. Our location is positioned perfectly to walk to a lot of the attractions. China Town being one since we are located right at the gates  and Union Square where there are lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. Being in our prime location does help save on the extra expense of transportation one might occur if staying at a different property.Overall  Mark it seems you did enjoy the hotel and the service provided. If you are ever back in San Francisco we do hope you choose Orchard Garden Hotel.Thanks again Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel

The pool gets a lot of sun in the morning which is nice for sipping coffee by or if it is warm enough a dip. The pool was heated where we didn't mind swimming in it even when the temp didn't get above 70. Breakfast was better than I expected. The eggs were actually scrambled not like the weird omelet I had before at a budget motel. We always had enough at breakfast to carry us through at least the next cuban sandwich shop. I used the gym there which was ok a few cardio machines including an elliptical and free weights and exercise balls. The nice thing was I was the only one in there both times I used it. The hotel isn't walking distance to much but we were able to find parking every time we went downtown. I think it was quieter because we weren't around any partying.

Our TV was vintage 1990's and matched the rest of the room.In the morning we went for breakfast and they ran out of food for a good 15 minutes. Everyone ate cereal and got out out. It's a hotel. They have a breakfast rush every morning. I would expect there to be someone monitoring the food.On the other hand the Coffee was great! They also have a pancake machine! For triple digits I'm disappointed with the stay. Will stay elsewhere next time.Dear lllClifflll Thank you for choosing the Holiday Inn Express Buckhead and for sharing your experience with us.

We asked for a late check out and the GM was very accommodating and made it happen even though they were sold out so thank you I know how difficult that can be!

My problem had begun right after we sold our home and we had been staying in a wonderful Residence Inn in Holtsville NY for over 3 months and loved it! They even helped arrange our stay here in Dallas. We have not been disappointed! The staff is helpful and friendly beyond words! The first room they gave us  as we had asked for a top floor in a quiet corner  had bar stool seating  which in my condition  was a problem. I thought I'd be eating on a computer desk for our month's stay! But as soon as my husband just mentioned it at the desk  we were allowed to see a handicap accessible room which turned out to be perfect. The room is clean and user friendly. It has a small kitchen with a microwave and 2 burners and supplies. There are lots of amenities. It is very comfortable. There are lovely complimentary breakfasts each morning with a wonderful variety as well as complimentary dinners 4 nights a week! The dining area is bright and cheerful. There is a lovely sitting area with a couch and armchairs and fireplace. The property is well kept with a beautiful pool area with a hot whirlpool and barbecue. The location is wonderful and once we learned the area  we found we are close to all sorts of stores and markets as well as Target  Walmart and Whole Foods. However you need a car to reach them. There is free Internet access and a downstairs computer if you do not have your own. There is also an exercise room that I regretfully can not take advantage of! However the most wonderful feature here is the staff...everyone of them! We will never be able to thank them enough for their kindness and helpfulness  whether it is with recommendations  directions or just being plain friendly. My husband and I have become big fans of Residence Inn! Both my children came to visit as well and loved it!Dear Guest We are truly blessed to have you as part of our Residence Inn family. We are so pleased that your surgery went well and we hope you are continuing to improve every day!We hope to see you and your wonderful family in the future. Take care.

What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products. These little touches made this mama's heart so happy! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.

She had requested dbl beds but be cause her room on her profile was king size  we ended up with a chair and a king size bed for 4 ppl. The next day we waited for someone to contact us and know on did.. We had to go to the desk and ask. They gave us a room w king bed and a pull out which would have been alright but we would have gotten exactly what was needed from another hotel in the area and cheaper if someone would have told us earlier in the day.After that they gave us one thin blanket for the pull out. Requested another and they were out. Finally got one . when the maid came to clean she took one of the blankets. We had to call down to correct that.. All in all it was a good trip but bad service... They need to communicate more with each other and there guess that are having problems to make there stay enjoyable and uncomplicated.Thank you for visiting the JW Marriott Atlanta for your special occasion. I am sorry we did not have the requested accommodations. I am also sorry that your blanket was slow to arrive and then once received  was removed by our housekeeping team.

The people that work here ALL seem to be friendly and helpful. Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs  sausage  biscuits  Oatmeal  potatos  waffle makers along with the normal fruit  cold cereral  yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs   check tenders  etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice  not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer  vodka  bloody marys  tonic water  orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free  so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot  then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky  high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect  just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy  but not a Motel 6.

Also popcorn and soda. The pool and hot tub are terrific and offer a nice view of the city. The hotel is located directly across from the stop 8 on the hop-on-off bus tour and next to public transit. Can't go wrong with this hotel.

It took us only 15-20 minutes to reach High Museum  Coke  Aquarium at 9:30 and return at 3:30. The property itself is very nice and the staff more that helpful/friendly. We will visit again.Thank you for staying with us! We hope to have you back very soon.

There are a few things that take away a point: the parking is tight even with our family minivan. We got unexpected wake up call from some body car alarm goes off in the middle of the night right outside our room! and one night from the shampoo dispenser in the bath room came off the wall and crashed in the bath tub. It would be nice if they install a room safe and a small refrigerator.Hello FNguyen  Thank you for taking time to review us here on Trip Advisor. We work hard to keep our rooms and property ultra clean and well maintained  our staff consistently offers superior service to all our guests. Thank you for recognizing our efforts! We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately  there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight  especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately  we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings  street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go  we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue. Your two suggestions have been passed on to the GM for consideration. We value our guests input and are always working on improving our little hotel. Again  thank you for sharing your experience with us. We hope to serve you again in the future! * Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service  Selection  and Value! * Yours in Hospitality Michelle C.

The bathroom is quite enough and clean after a long stroll around the city. I feel that the bed is new and I saw too that they are delivering new bed mattress to the other rooms. The price I paid for the hotel is just enough for the expectations. Kinda just exact. I didn't have any negative vibes. The ladies staffs are great and helpful. I will come back on this hotel.

I called ahead to find out the length of the bunk bed as we had a tall teen staying with us. They were very accommodating and measured the bed for me. I honestly cannot remember what the measurements were  but fit perfect for my friends daughter who is 5'4. Would have been a tight fit otherwise  unless you sleep curled in a ball! The hotel is set back from the street so no noise from traffic  and was a VERY short walk to the parks! You're literally across the street from the bus depot entrance! I would DEFINITLY stay here again (and plan to in May 2015)!

We walked to the Midway  the Maritime museum and the Seaport Village along with driving to the Zoo and Legoland. There is also a new park with water feature across from the Maritime museum that was a favorite spot for my 11 year old son. We stayed on the 15th floor. Our room was very nice and quiet but the bathroom has one of those sliding barn doors with a little bit of a gap when closed so not complete privacy. We heard someone complaining about it downstairs. The Wi-Fi worked fine during our 5 day stay. The breakfast was great all the mornings we were there. My son loved the waffles. You need to go down early though since with the size of the hotel  it could get crowded although there are a lot of seating options. The pool on the 5th floor was a little small but it was a great view of the city and water. There was a Starbucks across the street behind the Amtrak station so it was close enough. It is a very new area so I am guessing more food and drink options will be available soon.
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,We have stayed in downtown Atlanta many many times and usually stay at the Hilton downtown. We decided at the last minute to try this property and we made a great decision. The location and ease of getting to hotel were great. As I've read in past reviews and very true on our visit....parking in the main lot is very limited. We were greeted at checkin by two very friendly clerks. We were a little early  but our room was ready. True  the rooms are on the small side  but that doesn't take away from how comfortable the room really was. Every employee that we encountered were very friendly and helpful with directions or suggestions for restaurants or whatever. The breakfast is just what you are used to from a Hampton Inn....very good with plenty of choices. Cold water and cookies were available a the front desk when you came back to hotel in evening. Overall a great stay and will stay there again when we return in April. Oh  parking is 20.00 per day...for downtown not really that bad.

We were welcomed warmly and given a lovely room on the 7th floor overlooking the Bush Street. The staff were so friendly and helpful  nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast there every day over our 3 day stay and it was plentiful. freshly cooked and good value for money. Our room was spacious  clean and the bed really comfy. Housekeeping did an excellent job in looking after us. The only minor wrinkle was low water pressure in the shower. We would definitely recommend the Orchard Garden without hesitation. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.What a wonderful dose of encouragement  Sue! I'm so happy to hear that you felt very welcome and well taken care of with us.

0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,We stayed 4 nights at this boutique hotel. At first  we were quite disappointed about the rooms  being quite small and having a very tiny bathroom but it does the job. Though small  the setting was nice and the overall ambiance in the hotel is great. Unfortunately they didn't have rooms available with the two seperate beds  as they looked nicer. They have a very nice fitness  and a good business room. They have a small lounge on every floor nicely decorated. You cannot have breakfast at this hotel but starbucks is next to the hotel  and otherwise you could check the block for a nice restaurant such as the Brasserie.Bad point was the Valet service which was not very quick though  and our car seemed to have a few scratches when we got it back from them. Luckily the rental company didn't notice. Washing service is quite expensive as well.Overall quite a good stay!Dear Maxvdo Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. We do offer various types of accommodations  all ranging in size. Perhaps an Executive King on your next visit would be more suitable to you r needs. I have been working closely with the valet company to further improve their services. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience. I hope you will think of us again on your next visit to San Francisco. We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I have stayed at the property several times and both Ronda and Noelle Taylor make me feel at home when I arrive. I spend time in the lobby  the kitchen area and in the coffee bar and they have everything you need. I enjoy this property because the rooms are like apartments complete with living rooms and full kitchens!!!! I have stayed in the one bedroom King twice and the two bedroom Queen. I love them both but I have to say the two bedroom beats them all because it has two full bathroom and 3 TV's with a desk in one of the rooms. This is the perfect room for the business traveler like me because you can work and not disturb anyone else that may be staying with you in your suite. In addition the sofa in the living room folds out so you can bring the whole family for a weekend. This is an ideal location because it sits between Midtown and Buckhead  so there are restaurants  shopping in at least 2 major malls  The Marta which is the public transit system and rental car locations complete with exotic cars all within walking distance. I can't say enough great things about this property.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your review will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests.

You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking  because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance  as are the train to the airport  light rail to Lake Union  the monorail to the Seattle Center  and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit  the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic  there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out  the gym is fabulous  with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna  steam room  and whirlpool. And  although as a rule I don't believe in room service  especially in a city with such good local restaurants  the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit  excellent bread  local cheese  perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot  top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really  you can trust me. It's worth it.

The motel style units looked well worn out  but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room  which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me  but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them  about 3-4 miles from downtown  so there is a bit of traffic noise  but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper  ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay.

A very nice self serve breakfast with ample seating. This is a family and pet friendly hotel. My stay was over a holiday weekend and there were a few sports teams staying here. If you prefer a quite relaxing stay this hotel may not be for you. Kids running in the halls  riding the elevators  and screaming in the pool but then again  that is what kids do! However this may not be the norm since schools just let out. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping as well as movie theaters. It is right off Interstate 17 so easy off easy on.
0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms  one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room  however  was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely  the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but  aside from some peeling paint  both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles  eggs  sausages  toast  pastries  cold cereal  yogurt  fresh fruit) but  as has been noted by other reviews  the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately  we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us  it took 15 to 20 minutes  which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in  given the price  we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.

Easy on/off from I-15  lots of restaurant selections that you can either walk to or have a very short drive. The only thing for me was that the king bed was like sleeping on a slab of granite otherwise had an enjoyable stay and the staff were absolutely great.Dear Marvintm009 Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Marriott Rancho Bernardo. We would look forward to your return.Sincerely Francesca Suh
0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,The hotel was alright  this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same  rude staff  bugs in room  room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for  it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday  our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable  you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday  declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task  a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property  even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and  at the time  confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always  if we can be of any other assistance  please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely  Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managercasey.callaiswhitneyHotel.com
0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning  I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed  perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave  happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall  I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thank you Hotel Management

The only problem with this place is the parking is limited and spots that are available are harder to get into. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego/near SeaWorld for your recent visit. Our parking lot is more for your compact cars  so when a truck from worker stays with us it can throw off the spacing. We are continuing to explore what we can do to create more room for the vehicles . Thank you for your feedback. We hope you choose us again for your next visit.regardsBen

I appreciated the location and the pretty boulevard in a residential area. This is a classy looking brownstone  with elegant furnishings. The hotel was full when we stayed  yet so quiet. There is not a constant bustle of staff and guests. The service was just right. The room and bathroom were spacious and nicely furnished. We liked the homey touches of CDs and books in the room. I will definitely stay here again.

The location was great for walking around La Jolla or just along the shore where we saw harbor seals  sea lions and whales. San Diego was very close and we could easily explore new areas around San Diego. The service was excellent with little touches such as water and candy each night. It was nice to have breakfast with our stay included with our room and drinks in the lobby. We will definitely be back!Greetings Mark B Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your experience at our Inn as well as our phenomenal location. Our location  as you stated  definitely lends itself well to taking off on foot and exploring all that both the village of La Jolla has as well as the wonderful coastline. I appreciated your noting the teams attention to detail and ensuring that you were satisfied. Each of them do a wonderful job at looking after our guests. On behalf of everyone here  we eagerly await your return. Warmest wishes Mike
0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,Located in an up coming section of Buckhead  this somewhat older hotel sandwiched into a compact space shows some wear and tear  but proves to be a great find with exceptional front desk staff  helpful security  efficient and friendly breakfast and housekeeping staff  and an ultimately convenient location. Apparently quite popular with the business travelers  the hotel can get very busy and parking is a challenge during the week  but they seem to handle the volume and guest needs pretty well. They have a reliable shuttle service  great breakfast spread  and the place is consistently clean and welcoming. The room showed some signs of wear and had a damp feeling  but was outfitted nicely. I'd definitely stay there again for the price and convenience.We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. We are also happy to announce that we will be undergoing renovation soon and updating the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to right this review! We look forward to seeing you again the next time your travels bring you to the Buckhead area.

Very cheerful housekeeping folks (I hope they're union /or paid well with good bennies pensions!). Very comfortable beds with heaps of pillows. A good amount of space in the bathroom and bedroom. Location is extremely convenient. They offered a choice between a room on the street and a quiet room. The quiet room was very quiet indeed.Nice quality bath supplies  although they didn't always replace stuff when I used it up. Towels definitely fluffy  and I liked the bathrobes they provided. Only weak spots were TV (few channels  not great reception) and the wireless  although free (a must in any reasonable hotel) it is spotty.

They only try to get as much money out of your pocket as possible  they are 100 inflexible  the response in communication is very slow  you need to send questions a couple time to get the right answers  they send important information last minute or after a couple time of re-asking  Pro-activity is certainly one thing they are not aware of and the capacity-chart they send is far beyond any reality.Lavalampe0815 - I am sorry to hear of your recent experience and would be happy to connect personally with you to further discuss.

We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando  and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low  and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando  who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz  but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location  it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal  and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered  the carpets had wet spots  and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell  and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards  so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy  pipes were loud  and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed  and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room  but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned  and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side  the kids loved the pool  and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old  and the chairs are cheap  but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this  and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan  none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast  milk  OJ  and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants  and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much  much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost  especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck  and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
